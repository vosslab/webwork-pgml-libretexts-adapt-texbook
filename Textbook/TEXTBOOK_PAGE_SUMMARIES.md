# Textbook page summaries

This document provides a high-level summary of each HTML page in `Textbook/` to help plan and organize the book.

Guideline: each entry below has exactly three sentences describing purpose, what you will have accomplished by the end, what you can do immediately after finishing, and how to apply it in practice, but written in natural prose without using formal educational jargon.
SEO tags appear on a separate line under each entry; aim for 3 tags, but allow fewer or more when it helps.
Prefer tags that make the page easy to find by its unique topic, rather than repeating the same global tags on every page.

## Chapter 1: Introduction
- `Textbook/01_Introduction/1.0-Index.html`: Introduces the book with a section map and a practical PG vs PGML split for science-first authoring, noting that this guide is based on the PG 2.17 subset found in ADAPT and webwork-pg-renderer. After finishing, you can pick a task-based starting point from the "Where to start today" table, know where PGML belongs, and understand that some macros from full PG distributions are not available in this subset. Use it as your orientation page before jumping into terms, quickstart, or templates, and see Chapter 2.4 for the macro allowlist reference.
  SEO tags: science assessment, PGML-first authoring, PG 2.17 subset
- `Textbook/01_Introduction/1.1-What_is_WeBWorK.html`: Explains what WeBWorK is and how PGML fits into a typical problem, with notes on the PG 2.17 subset used in ADAPT. After finishing, you can separate minimal setup from the PGML prompt, focus effort in the right place, and understand that this guide targets a flattened PG macro tree with some macros unavailable. Use it when you need a clear mental model of what a WeBWorK problem file is doing and what constraints apply in ADAPT and the local renderer.
  SEO tags: WeBWorK basics, MathObjects, ADAPT constraints
- `Textbook/01_Introduction/1.2-Why_use_WeBWorK.html`: Describes why WeBWorK works well for repeated practice with immediate feedback in science courses.

  SEO tags: setup vs prompt, hints and solutions, maintainable structure
- `Textbook/02_Problem_Generation_PG/2.5-Common_PG_Macros.html`: Organizes macros available in the PG 2.17 subset into a minimal core, interaction add-ons, and science-native helpers, with missing-macro symptoms and a reference to the full allowlist, plus a version comparison table showing macro availability across ADAPT/renderer subset, full PG 2.17+, and PG 2.20 (current). After finishing, you can build a minimal `loadMacros()` block from the subset, recognize which macro you need for a specific interaction, understand why checkbox and some other macros are unavailable, and check the allowlist when a macro from online examples is not available. Use it when a problem needs a new interaction pattern and you are not sure which macro file enables it, and consult the version comparison when online examples use macros missing from the ADAPT/renderer subset.
  SEO tags: loadMacros, macro allowlist, version comparison
- `Textbook/02_Problem_Generation_PG/2.6-Legacy_PG_and_deprecated_patterns.html`: Shows how to recognize legacy PG patterns and deprecated approaches that are common in online examples and older problem libraries, with a fast PGML-first rewrite recipe and a PopUp warning. After finishing, you can triage a copied problem quickly, identify what is safe to reuse, and translate the core idea into a PGML-first structure without importing fragile formatting or scattered grading logic. Use it before copy-pasting random examples, especially when a problem relies on long `BEGIN_TEXT/END_TEXT` blocks, heavy Perl string assembly, or macros you do not recognize.
  SEO tags: legacy PG, deprecated patterns, safe refactoring

After finishing, you can emit raw HTML for layouts without adding empty TeX wrappers, merge consecutive MODES calls, and pass HTML variables through PGML with the trailing asterisk. Use it as the foundation for all HTML-only techniques in this chapter including two-column layouts, custom styling, and coloring, since MODES is the recommended method for injecting HTML that PGML cannot express.
  SEO tags: MODES wrapper, HTML-only patterns, PGML escaping
- `Textbook/06_Advanced_PGML_Techniques/6.2-Coloring_text_and_emphasis.html`: Shows how to use CSS-based styling via MODES wrappers and HTML spans to emphasize critical words like ABOVE/BELOW or NOT, explaining why TeX color commands do not work reliably in the PG 2.17 subset. After finishing, you can add visual emphasis using high-contrast colors and bold weight while keeping TeX output empty for renderer compatibility, building on the MODES patterns from 6.1. Use it when you need to highlight key terms or distinguish replacement-rule classes in matching or multiple choice problems, and avoid MathJax color macros that will not render.
  SEO tags: CSS coloring, HTML spans, emphasis styling
- `Textbook/06_Advanced_PGML_Techniques/6.3-Tables_with_niceTables.html`: Explains DataTable versus LayoutTable patterns and why niceTables.pl is the only supported way to create tables since HTML table tags (table, tr, td, th) are blocked in this install. After finishing, you can choose DataTable for semantic data with headers or LayoutTable for visual layouts, set table-level options like center and horizontalrules, and avoid blocked HTML tags. Use it when presenting measurements, observations, or structured data in science prompts, and when you need accessible, renderer-compatible tables. Includes biology examples: dilution series data, enzyme kinetics measurements, gel/blot comparison tables.
  SEO tags: niceTables.pl, DataTable vs LayoutTable, blocked HTML tags
- `Textbook/06_Advanced_PGML_Techniques/6.4-Matching_problems.html`: Provides comprehensive coverage of modern matching problems using PopUp widgets with HTML-only flexbox layouts (via MODES), replacement-rule colors, and fixed label-to-meaning mappings. After finishing, you can build two-column matching layouts keeping TeX output empty, apply CSS styling to right-column labels, and handle randomized ordering without breaking color associations. Use it when implementing matching for definitions, associations, or concept mappings in science, referencing the yaml_match_to_pgml.py generator for production patterns. Includes biology examples: chemical bond types, pathway components, genetics terminology.
  SEO tags: matching layouts, PopUp widgets, flexbox HTML-only
- `Textbook/06_Advanced_PGML_Techniques/6.5-Multiple_choice_statements.html`: Covers multiple choice statements patterns where students evaluate true/false or correct/incorrect for each statement, using RadioButtons or PopUp widgets per statement rather than a single select-all checkbox. After finishing, you can build statement-by-statement evaluation prompts, apply replacement-rule styling to emphasize key words, and avoid checkbox macros (like parserCheckboxList.pl) that are missing from the PG 2.17 subset. Use it for concept checks where multiple independent true/false decisions test understanding better than selecting one best answer, referencing yaml_mc_statements_to_pgml.py for implementation details. Includes biology examples: experimental design statements, pathway regulation claims.
  SEO tags: statement evaluation, true/false per statement, RadioButtons pattern
- `Textbook/06_Advanced_PGML_Techniques/6.6-Advanced_randomization_patterns.html`: Summarizes PG randomization functions available in the PG 2.17 subset including random_subset, list_random, guards for degenerate cases, and deterministic seeding with problemSeed. After finishing, you can write stable randomization that avoids zero denominators, repeated values, invalid domains, and hash key order issues while keeping magnitudes bounded and readable. Use it when building problems with complex random selections, interacting constraints, or when debugging non-reproducible behavior across seeds. Includes biology examples: randomized dilution factors, randomized genetics crosses, randomized qPCR conditions.
  SEO tags: PG randomization, problemSeed determinism, guard patterns

## Chapter 7: Local Testing with webwork-pg-renderer
- `Textbook/07_Local_Testing_with_webwork_pg_renderer/7.0-Index.html`: Positions webwork-pg-renderer as a faster way to preview and debug problems when ADAPT only shows a generic error, and clarifies what local rendering does and does not replace. After finishing, you can decide when to use local rendering versus ADAPT preview, confirm the minimal prerequisites (podman/docker), check renderer health with GET /health, and follow the "record file path + seed" rule to keep failures reproducible. Use it as the entry point for a first-pass testing loop that gets you line-level errors before you do final checks in ADAPT, noting that the renderer uses the same PG 2.17 subset as ADAPT.
  SEO tags: local PG testing, reproducible seed, renderer health check
- `Textbook/07_Local_Testing_with_webwork_pg_renderer/7.1-Quickstart_and_editor_workflow.html`: Walks through renderer setup with private/ folder mounting, the web editor at localhost:3000, and a reproducible edit loop using file path plus seed. After finishing, you can place .pg files in private/, use the editor interface to load and render with a fixed seed, and verify that the prompt and blanks read correctly before moving on. Use it during day-to-day authoring when you want fast iteration from the browser editor, or when testing problems before importing to ADAPT, and check /health first to confirm the renderer is running.
  SEO tags: private folder, web editor, localhost workflow
- `Textbook/07_Local_Testing_with_webwork_pg_renderer/7.2-API_usage_for_scripts.html`: Explains the renderer API with POST / as the primary endpoint (and POST /render-api for compatibility), parameter precedence (problemSourceURL > problemSource > sourceFilePath), and when to use sourceFilePath versus problemSource. After finishing, you can call the renderer from scripts using curl or Python, choose between form-encoded and JSON requests, and handle lint output from _format json responses. Use it when building automated testing or linting workflows, and when you need to render problems programmatically rather than through the web editor.
  SEO tags: render API, POST endpoints, programmatic testing
- `Textbook/07_Local_Testing_with_webwork_pg_renderer/7.3-Testing_habits_and_troubleshooting.html`: Adds a "start here" triage, a common-failures table, and a minimal debugging note template on top of the existing QA pass. After finishing, you can isolate render failures quickly using the editor or API, map symptoms to likely causes (missing macros, blocked HTML tags, PGML parse errors), and sweep variants without losing the reproducible case. Use it as a repeatable first-pass QA loop before an ADAPT preview and before importing or publishing a revised problem, and check that the renderer returns 200 status and valid HTML or JSON.
  SEO tags: triage checklist, failure patterns, QA loop

## Chapter 90: Appendices
- `Textbook/90_Appendices/90.0-Index.html`: Introduces the appendices as quick-reference material including minimal templates, a concise glossary, and a troubleshooting checklist. After finishing, you can navigate to resources when you need a starting template, a term definition, or a diagnostic path for common failures.
