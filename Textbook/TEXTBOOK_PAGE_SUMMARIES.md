# Textbook page summaries

This document provides a high-level summary of each HTML page in `Textbook/` to help plan and organize the book.

Guideline: each entry below has exactly three sentences describing purpose, what you will have accomplished by the end, what you can do immediately after finishing, and how to apply it in practice, but written in natural prose without using formal educational jargon.
SEO tags appear on a separate line under each entry; aim for 3 tags, but allow fewer or more when it helps.
Prefer tags that make the page easy to find by its unique topic, rather than repeating the same global tags on every page.

## Chapter 1: Introduction
- `Textbook/01_Introduction/1.0-Index.html`: Introduces the book with a section map and a practical PG vs PGML split for science-first authoring, noting that this guide is based on the PG 2.17 subset found in ADAPT and webwork-pg-renderer. After finishing, you can pick a task-based starting point from the "Where to start today" table, know where PGML belongs, and understand that some macros from full PG distributions are not available in this subset. Use it as your orientation page before jumping into terms, quickstart, or templates, and see Chapter 2.4 for the macro allowlist reference.

- `Textbook/02_Problem_Generation_PG/2.4-Sections_within_a_PG_question.html`: Breaks down the four traditional sections (Preamble, Setup, Statement, Solution) in a PGML-first style and adds a "where does this go?" map for common tasks. After finishing, you can keep the OPL header, setup, prompt text, and optional solution material separated and easier to maintain. Use it when refactoring a messy problem into a clean structure or deciding where new content belongs.
  SEO tags: setup vs prompt, hints and solutions, maintainable structure
- `Textbook/02_Problem_Generation_PG/2.5-Common_PG_Macros.html`: Organizes macros available in the PG 2.17 subset into a minimal core, interaction add-ons, and science-native helpers, with missing-macro symptoms and a reference to the full allowlist, plus a version comparison table showing macro availability across ADAPT/renderer subset, full PG 2.17+, and PG 2.20 (current). After finishing, you can build a minimal `loadMacros()` block from the subset, recognize which macro you need for a specific interaction, understand why checkbox and some other macros are unavailable, and check the allowlist when a macro from online examples is not available. Use it when a problem needs a new interaction pattern and you are not sure which macro file enables it, and consult the version comparison when online examples use macros missing from the ADAPT/renderer subset.
  SEO tags: loadMacros, macro allowlist, version comparison
- `Textbook/02_Problem_Generation_PG/2.6-Legacy_PG_and_deprecated_patterns.html`: Shows how to recognize legacy PG patterns and deprecated approaches that are common in online examples and older problem libraries, with a fast PGML-first rewrite recipe and a PopUp warning. After finishing, you can triage a copied problem quickly, identify what is safe to reuse, and translate the core idea into a PGML-first structure without importing fragile formatting or scattered grading logic. Use it before copy-pasting random examples, especially when a problem relies on long `BEGIN_TEXT/END_TEXT` blocks, heavy Perl string assembly, or macros you do not recognize.
  SEO tags: legacy PG, deprecated patterns, safe refactoring
