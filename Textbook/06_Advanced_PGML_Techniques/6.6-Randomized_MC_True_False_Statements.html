<p>
This page shows how to build statement-by-statement evaluation prompts using RadioButtons or
PopUp widgets for each statement. It also covers how to create YAML-based statement banks and
generate multiple-choice "Which statement is TRUE/FALSE?" questions from them.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Use this page when:</strong> you want students to mark each statement as true/false or
correct/incorrect rather than choose one best answer, or when you want to generate
multiple-choice questions from curated pools of true and false statements. For basic
single-answer multiple choice, see <a href="/@go/page/555715">Section 5.2</a>. For
checkbox-style multiple answer, see <a href="/@go/page/555716">Section 5.3</a>.
</p>

<h2>When to use MC statements vs matching sets</h2>
<p>
Statement-based multiple choice is best when you want students to <strong>evaluate ideas</strong>
(truth or falsehood), not just map terms to definitions.
</p>
<p>
Good fits for MC statements:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>"Which statement is TRUE/FALSE?" conceptual checks</li>
	<li>Misconception diagnostics (wrong molecule, wrong direction, wrong location, sign flips)</li>
	<li>"Why" and "what changes" logic that is hard to make one-to-one</li>
</ul>
<p>
If your goal is to map terms or components to their matching definitions or functions (especially
pathways and part-to-function), consider a matching set instead (see Chapter 6.3).
</p>

<h2>Copy and edit (RadioButtons per statement)</h2>
<pre>
$tf = [ 'True', 'False' ];
$rb1 = RadioButtons($tf, 'True');
$rb2 = RadioButtons($tf, 'False');

BEGIN_PGML
1. The enzyme activity increases with temperature. [_]{$rb1}

2. The inhibitor decreases Vmax in competitive inhibition. [_]{$rb2}
END_PGML
</pre>

<h2>Common failure and fix</h2>
<pre>
Broken: parserCheckboxList.pl used for statement checks
What you will see: widget missing or render failure
Fix: use RadioButtons or PopUp per statement
</pre>

<h2>Styling and emphasis</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Use HTML spans to emphasize key words like NOT or ONLY.</li>
	<li>Keep each statement short so students can scan quickly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creating statement banks with YAML</h2>
<p>
Instead of hand-coding each PGML problem, you can define pools of true and false statements in
a YAML file and use a generator script to produce multiple-choice questions automatically. Each
generated question presents one correct answer among several distractors drawn from the bank.
</p>

<h3>YAML file structure</h3>
<p>
Each YAML file requires three top-level keys:
</p>
<table class="mt-responsive-table">
<colgroup>
<col />
<col />
<col />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Key</th>
<th>Required</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td data-th="Key"><code>topic</code></td>
<td data-th="Required">Yes</td>
<td data-th="Description">Short phrase used in the question stem (e.g., <code>DNA structure</code>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-th="Key"><code>true_statements</code></td>
<td data-th="Required">Yes</td>
<td data-th="Description">Mapping of statement IDs to correct statement text</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-th="Key"><code>false_statements</code></td>
<td data-th="Required">Yes</td>
<td data-th="Description">Mapping of statement IDs to incorrect statement text</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Common optional keys</h3>
<table class="mt-responsive-table">
<colgroup>
<col />
<col />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Key</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td data-th="Key"><code>connection_words</code></td>
<td data-th="Description">YAML list of stem connectors (defaults to built-in words like <code>concerning</code>, <code>about</code>, <code>regarding</code>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-th="Key"><code>replacement_rules</code></td>
<td data-th="Description">Mapping of literal substring replacements for consistent formatting or color</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-th="Key"><code>override_question_true</code></td>
<td data-th="Description">Replace the TRUE stem with custom text, or set to <code>~</code> to disable TRUE questions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-th="Key"><code>override_question_false</code></td>
<td data-th="Description">Replace the FALSE stem with custom text, or set to <code>~</code> to disable FALSE questions</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
In YAML, <code>~</code> means null (like Python <code>None</code>). For
<code>connection_words</code>, null means "use the built-in defaults." For override keys, null
means "disable that question form entirely."
</p>

<h3>Statement IDs and conflict groups</h3>
<p>
Statement IDs follow the pattern <code>truth&lt;N&gt;a</code>, <code>truth&lt;N&gt;b</code>,
<code>false&lt;N&gt;a</code>, <code>false&lt;N&gt;b</code>, and so on. Statements that share
the same number represent the <strong>same concept with different phrasing</strong>. The
generator automatically prevents variants of the same concept from appearing together in one
question.
</p>
<pre>
true_statements:
  truth3a: Enzymes lower activation energy.
  truth3b: Enzymes speed reactions by lowering activation energy.
</pre>
<p>
Because <code>truth3a</code> and <code>truth3b</code> share the number 3, they will never both
appear as choices in the same generated question. This lets you author multiple equivalent
phrasings for the same idea without creating confusing near-duplicate answer choices.
</p>

<h3>Replacement rules for formatting consistency</h3>
<p>
The <code>replacement_rules</code> key is a simple search-and-replace table applied to all
question text and choices. It is commonly used for:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Highlighting key terms with HTML color spans</li>
	<li>Consistent symbols and typography (e.g., <code>&amp;Delta;G</code>, <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>)</li>
</ul>
<pre>
replacement_rules:
  cAMP: "&lt;strong&gt;cAMP&lt;/strong&gt;"
  cGMP: "&lt;strong&gt;cGMP&lt;/strong&gt;"
</pre>

<h2>Generating PGML files from YAML</h2>
<p>
The <code>yaml_mc_statements_to_pgml.py</code> script reads the same YAML schema described
above and generates WeBWorK PGML problem files. This workflow uses the same statement bank
format, so you can maintain one YAML file and produce both Blackboard export files and PGML
problems from it.
</p>
<pre>
source source_me.sh
python3 yaml_mc_statements_to_pgml.py -y your_set.yml -x 20
</pre>
<p>
The <code>-x</code> flag controls how many question variants to generate. By default, the
generator creates both "Which statement is TRUE?" and "Which statement is FALSE?" forms. You
can disable either form with <code>--no-true</code> or <code>--no-false</code>.
</p>

<h2>Second messenger signaling example (complete YAML)</h2>
<pre>
---
topic: second messenger signaling
learning_objective: Distinguish cAMP vs cGMP roles and enzymes that regulate them.

replacement_rules:
  cAMP: "&lt;strong&gt;cAMP&lt;/strong&gt;"
  cGMP: "&lt;strong&gt;cGMP&lt;/strong&gt;"

true_statements:
  truth1a: cAMP is a second messenger made from ATP
  truth1b: cyclic AMP (cAMP) is produced from ATP by adenylyl cyclase
  truth2: phosphodiesterase breaks down cyclic nucleotides to terminate a signal
  truth3: Protein kinase A (PKA) is activated by cAMP

false_statements:
  false1a: cAMP is a second messenger made from glucose
  false1b: cyclic AMP (cAMP) is produced from ADP by phosphodiesterase
  false2: phosphodiesterase makes cAMP from ATP
  false3: Protein kinase A (PKA) is activated by cGMP
</pre>
<p>
Note the conflict groups: <code>truth1a</code> and <code>truth1b</code> both describe how cAMP
is made, so they share number 1 and will not appear together. The same applies to
<code>false1a</code> and <code>false1b</code>.
</p>

<h2>What makes a good false statement</h2>
<p>
False statements should be "plausible but wrong" in a way that diagnoses a specific
misconception. Good patterns include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Wrong substrate or reactant:</strong> ATP vs GTP, NADH vs NADPH</li>
	<li><strong>Wrong directionality:</strong> influx vs efflux, synthesis vs degradation</li>
	<li><strong>Wrong cellular location:</strong> nucleus vs cytosol vs mitochondrion</li>
	<li><strong>Swapped cofactors or ions:</strong> Mg2+ vs Ca2+</li>
	<li><strong>Wrong sign or relationship:</strong> reversed thermodynamic logic using delta-G or equilibrium</li>
</ul>
<p>
Practical trick: write the true statement first, then create the false version by changing
exactly one detail.
</p>

<h2>Avoiding accidental cues</h2>
<p>
Three quick checks that prevent students from using test-taking strategies instead of content
knowledge:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Similar length:</strong> Do not let one statement be noticeably longer or shorter than the others.</li>
	<li><strong>Parallel grammar:</strong> Use the same sentence structure across all choices (all noun phrases, or all full sentences).</li>
	<li><strong>No unique keywords:</strong> Avoid terms that appear in only one choice, as they can give away the answer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Additional statement hygiene: one main idea per statement (avoid "and also..." bundles), use
concrete biology verbs (binds, phosphorylates, opens, inhibits), avoid double negatives, and
define abbreviations on first use.
</p>

<h2>Difficulty control</h2>
<p>
You can adjust question difficulty by varying how the false statements are constructed:
</p>
<table class="mt-responsive-table">
<colgroup>
<col />
<col />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Difficulty</th>
<th>Strategy</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td data-th="Difficulty">Easier</td>
<td data-th="Strategy">Use direct definitions and unique vocabulary. Keep false statements clearly wrong with one obvious error.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-th="Difficulty">Harder</td>
<td data-th="Strategy">Make false statements "plausible but wrong" using common misconceptions. Use more similar terms across choices, relying on conflict groups to avoid near-duplicates in the same question.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Quality checks for statement banks</h2>
<p>
Before using a bank in an assessment, run through this checklist:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Misfiled statements:</strong> Confirm all <code>truth*</code> entries are under <code>true_statements</code> and all <code>false*</code> entries are under <code>false_statements</code>.</li>
	<li><strong>ID collisions:</strong> Do not reuse the same ID for two unrelated meanings (e.g., two different <code>truth5a</code> ideas).</li>
	<li><strong>Duplicate text:</strong> The generator fails if the exact same sentence appears twice, even across true and false sections.</li>
	<li><strong>Replacement rule overlap:</strong> Use specific, non-overlapping phrases to avoid nested spans or partial matches.</li>
	<li><strong>Grammar scan:</strong> Fix typos and subject/verb agreement. Correct grammar improves student trust even when the biology is right.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Biology examples to model</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Experimental design statements (controls, variables, replication).</li>
	<li>Pathway regulation claims (activation vs repression).</li>
</ul>
