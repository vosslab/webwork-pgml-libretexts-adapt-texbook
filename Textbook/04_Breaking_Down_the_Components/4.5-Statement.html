<p style="background-color: #ffedd5; padding: 6px 10px;"><strong>Statement</strong></p>
<p>
The Statement is the student-facing prompt written in <a href="/@go/page/488660">PGML</a>
(Chapter 3). It is where the story, data, and tasks become visible, and where each blank must be
tied to one answer object from Setup.
</p>
<p>
The Statement never grades anything. Blanks are just hooks into Setup, and PGML reads top to
bottom like a worksheet, not like code. If something grades incorrectly, the cause is almost
never here, even if the formatting looks scary.
</p>

<h2>How to read this code</h2>
<p>
The statement is the only part of the file that students actually read. Your goal here is to
keep the text readable while making sure every blank is unambiguous and attached to the correct
answer checker. PGML allows you to do this without mixing formatting logic into setup code.
</p>
<p>
The excerpt below shows the full statement used in the example, including how answer objects are
inserted into the text.
</p>
<pre>
BEGIN_PGML
My favorite color is

[_]{$radio1}

The same question with horizontal options:

My favorite color is [_]{$radio2}
END_PGML

<p>
If grading works but students are confused, the problem is usually here rather than in setup.
Read the statement out loud and check whether each blank clearly signals what kind of answer is
expected.
</p>

<p>
Think of the Statement as a contract. The text you show here must match what the checker
accepts, or students will feel the grading is arbitrary even when their reasoning is right.
Example: the prompt asks for one choice, but the blank is tied to a different answer object.
</p>
<p>
Choose the structure that reduces reading load: use short paragraphs for a single task, lists for
steps, and tables for multi-value data. For emphasis and color options, see
<a href="/@go/page/555723">Section 6.1</a>. If a prompt feels hard to scan, structure is usually
the fix, not more words.
</p>
<p>
Why this exists: it is the student-facing prompt that ties the story to the answer blanks.

Fast test: render one seed, enter the expected answer, confirm grading, then change the seed and
repeat.

<p>
Blank binding smell test: if a blank is visible but always marks wrong, confirm it is attached to
an answer object defined in Setup.
</p>

<h2>Broken example: blank attached to the wrong answer object</h2>
<p>
This is one of the most common PGML mistakes. The problem renders cleanly, but answers are
silently mismatched.
</p>
<pre>
BEGIN_PGML
The enzyme with the highest activity is [_]{$radio2}.
END_PGML
</pre>
<p>
In setup, <code>$radio1</code> and <code>$radio2</code> are both defined, but
<code>$radio2</code> corresponds to a different question.
</p>
<p><strong>What went wrong</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The blank is bound to the wrong answer object.</li>
	<li>The prompt text and grading logic no longer refer to the same concept.</li>
	<li>There is no syntax error, so nothing warns the author.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to recognize it</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The blank accepts input, but grading feels random.</li>
	<li>Swapping answers between blanks changes which one grades correctly.</li>
	<li>Reviewing setup reveals multiple answer objects with similar names.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to fix it</strong></p>
<p>
Use consistent naming and keep the statement immediately adjacent to the setup during editing.
When in doubt, temporarily print <code>-&gt;correct_ans</code> in the solution to confirm alignment.
</p>

<p>
Use tables only when there is real data to scan or compare, not to simulate layout. Lists and
short paragraphs are usually better for narrative prompts.

For radio buttons and other choice-based inserts, load <code>parserRadioButtons.pl</code> and
follow the OpenWeBWorK technique samples for multiple choice patterns, using those pages as the
pattern directory.
</p>

<p>
MultiAnswer is an optional advanced variant for interdependent blanks; use the
<code>parserMultiAnswer.pl</code> documentation and its sample problem when you need shared logic.
