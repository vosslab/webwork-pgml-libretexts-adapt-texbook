<p style="background-color: #ffedd5; padding: 6px 10px;"><strong>Statement</strong></p>
<p>
The Statement is the student-facing prompt written in PGML. It is where the story, data, and tasks
become visible, and where each blank must be tied to one answer object from Setup.
</p>
<p>
Think of the Statement as a contract. The text and units you show here must match what the checker
accepts, or students will feel the grading is arbitrary even when the math is right. Example:
the prompt says &mu;M but the checker expects mM or unitless input.
</p>
<p>
Choose the structure that reduces reading load: use short paragraphs for a single task, lists for
steps, and tables for multi-value data. If a prompt feels hard to scan, structure is usually the
fix, not more words.
</p>
<p>
Why this exists: it is the student-facing prompt that ties the story to the answer blanks.

Fast test: render one seed, enter the expected answer, confirm grading, then change the seed and repeat.

Blank binding smell test: if a blank is visible but always marks wrong, confirm it is attached to
an answer object defined in Setup.
</p>

<p>
Use tables only when there is real data to scan or compare, not to simulate layout. Lists and
short paragraphs are usually better for narrative prompts.

If you use choice-based inserts, load <code>PGchoicemacros.pl</code> and follow the OpenWeBWorK
technique samples for multiple choice and related patterns, using those pages as the pattern
directory.

<p>
MultiAnswer is an optional advanced variant for interdependent blanks; use the
<code>parserMultiAnswer.pl</code> documentation and its sample problem when you need shared logic.
