<p>
This chapter helps you find and fix problems in your WeBWorK questions. Whether you are setting up
local rendering for the first time, debugging a broken problem, or doing a final check before
publishing, start here to find the right section.
</p>

<p>
Debugging WeBWorK problems is not fundamentally different from troubleshooting a lab protocol. You
isolate the variable that changed, reproduce the failure under controlled conditions, and fix one
thing at a time. The tools in this chapter give you a fast feedback loop so you spend less time
guessing and more time writing good questions.

<h2>Start here</h2>
<ul>
	<li>If you are new to local rendering, start with <a href="/@go/page/555732">Section 7.1</a>. It walks you through installing the renderer and confirming your first problem file works.</li>
	<li>If something just broke, go to <a href="/@go/page/555733">Section 7.2</a>. It is organized by symptom so you can look up what you see and find a fix without reading everything else first.</li>
	<li>If you are about to publish, go to <a href="/@go/page/557412">Section 7.5</a>. The QA checklist catches the problems that look fine in author view but fail when students encounter them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apply it today</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Use the decision table above to jump directly to the section that matches your current situation instead of reading the chapter front to back.</li>
	<li>Keep the QA checklist from <a href="/@go/page/557412">Section 7.5</a> open as a tab while you finalize problems for a new assignment.</li>
</ul>
