<p>
This page only covers the PG you need to support a PGML prompt.
</p>

<p>
PG is the language used to define WeBWorK problems. It is implemented in Perl and uses macros to
provide features like answer checking, randomization, and formatting.
</p>

<p>
This guide discourages writing long prompts in "regular PG". Instead, treat PG as the setup layer
and write the student-facing prompt in PGML.
</p>

<h2>The minimum PG you need</h2>
<ul>
	<li><code>DOCUMENT();</code> at the top of the file.</li>
	<li><code>loadMacros(...);</code> including <code>PGML.pl</code> and MathObjects.</li>
	<li>A small setup block: random values, computed answers, and answer checkers.</li>
	<li>A PGML text block between <code>BEGIN_PGML</code> and <code>END_PGML</code>.</li>
	<li><code>ENDDOCUMENT();</code> at the end of the file.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This page does not cover custom Perl subroutines, long loops, or heavy conditional prompt
generation. If you feel pulled toward writing a Perl novel, stop and consider tightening ranges,
simplifying the prompt, or choosing a different interaction pattern instead.
</p>

<h2>How much Perl do I need to know?</h2>
<p>
Usually: a little. Most problems only need a few scalar variables (like <code>$a</code>,
<code>$b</code>) and a few MathObjects created with <code>Compute()</code> or <code>Real()</code>.
If you keep your setup small and your prompt in PGML, you can author effectively without learning
advanced Perl patterns.
</p>

<h2>A mindset for science problems</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Randomize the values, not the story.</li>
	<li>Keep units explicit and consistent (and prevent unit drift: &mu;M vs mM, &mu;L vs mL).</li>
	<li>Use realistic ranges (no negative concentrations, no 10,000 &mu;L pipettes).</li>
	<li>For text answers, state naming expectations (gene/protein symbols, case, and hyphens).</li>
	<li>Prefer one or two answer blanks with clear interpretation.</li>
	<li>When you need a table or structured layout, reach for PGML helpers rather than ad-hoc HTML.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Safe defaults (micro-pattern)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Choose a context early.</li>
	<li>Define a small set of values with constrained ranges.</li>
	<li>Define answers as MathObjects.</li>
	<li>Attach answers directly to blanks in PGML.</li>
</ul>
