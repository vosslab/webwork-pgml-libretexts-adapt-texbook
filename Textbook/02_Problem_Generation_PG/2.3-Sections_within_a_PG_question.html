<p>
This page only covers the PG you need to support a PGML prompt.
</p>

<p>
Use this page when refactoring a problem or when answers feel disconnected from the prompt.
</p>

<p>
Most WeBWorK examples describe a PG file as having several sections (description, initialization,
setup, text, answers/solutions). That model is still useful, but when you write PGML-first, the
roles shift:
</p>

<h2>Recommended sections (PGML-first)</h2>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Description / tags (optional)</strong>: comments at the top so other authors can find
		and reuse the problem.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Initialization</strong>: <code>DOCUMENT();</code> and <code>loadMacros(...)</code>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Setup</strong>: define variables and answers, pick a context, set tolerances.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Text (PGML)</strong>: the prompt between <code>BEGIN_PGML</code> and <code>END_PGML</code>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Solution / hint (optional)</strong>: use <code>BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION</code> or
		<code>BEGIN_PGML_HINT</code> when you want a structured solution.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>End</strong>: <code>ENDDOCUMENT();</code>.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why answers often live inside the PGML text</h2>
<p>
When you attach the correct answer directly to an answer blank (for example
<code>[______]{Real(12)}</code>), the connection between prompt and grading stays obvious. This is
especially helpful for science prompts with multiple values and multiple parts.
</p>

<p>
Rule of thumb: if it is a sentence the student reads, it belongs in PGML.
