<p>
This page only covers the PG you need to support a PGML prompt.
</p>

<p>
WeBWorK problems are written in PG, but this guide is not trying to turn instructors into Perl
developers. Regular PG is treated as the minimum setup needed to support a clean PGML prompt:
define a few variables, define answer checkers, and let PGML carry the student-facing text.
</p>

<h2>What PG is used for in this guide</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Load the macros needed for PGML and answer checking.</li>
	<li>Choose a MathObjects context that matches the expected input.</li>
	<li>Generate a small number of randomized values with sensible ranges.</li>
	<li>Compute the target answer(s) and attach the right answer checkers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What regular PG is not used for in this guide</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Writing the prompt as long blocks of <code>BEGIN_TEXT/END_TEXT</code>.</li>
	<li>Building complex formatting by hand (PGML is preferred).</li>
	<li>Turning a single problem into a large Perl script.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If a problem feels like it needs complexity, prefer clearer prompts, tighter ranges, or a
different interaction pattern before adding more PG logic.
</p>

<h2>How this chapter fits the book</h2>
<p>
Chapter 2 exists because every PGML problem still needs some PG scaffolding (macros, variables,
answers). The goal is to keep that scaffolding short, readable, and reusable.
