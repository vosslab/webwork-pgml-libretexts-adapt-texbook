<p>
This page only covers the PG you need to support a PGML prompt.
</p>

<h2>Start here (task first)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I need to add metadata headers (OPL) -> Section 2.2.</li>
	<li>I need a clean starter .pg skeleton -> <a href="/@go/page/488657">Section 2.3</a>.</li>
	<li>I need to know where setup ends and PGML begins -> <a href="/@go/page/488658">Section 2.4</a>.</li>
	<li>My problem does not render, missing macro or context? -> <a href="/@go/page/488659">Section 2.5</a>.</li>
	<li>I copied code from the internet and it looks weird -> <a href="/@go/page/555742">Section 2.6</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you are copy-editing a working problem, you can skip this chapter and come back only when you
need to change setup behavior.
</p>

<p>
WeBWorK problems are written in PG (see <a href="/@go/page/488656">Section 2.1</a> for an introduction), but this guide is not trying to turn instructors into Perl
developers. Regular PG is treated as the minimum setup needed to support a clean PGML prompt:
define a few variables, define answer checkers, and let PGML carry the student-facing text.
</p>

<p>
Library-quality problems also need an OPL header section that comes before <code>DOCUMENT()</code>,
so the five-section reality is: OPL header, Preamble, Setup, Statement, and Solution.
</p>

<h2>What PG is used for in this guide</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Load the macros needed for PGML and answer checking.</li>
	<li>Choose a MathObjects context that matches the expected input.</li>
	<li>Generate a small number of randomized values with sensible ranges.</li>
	<li>Compute the target answer(s) and attach the right answer checkers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What regular PG is not used for in this guide</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Writing the prompt as long blocks of <code>BEGIN_TEXT/END_TEXT</code>.</li>
	<li>Building complex formatting by hand (PGML is preferred).</li>
	<li>Turning a single problem into a large Perl script.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If a problem feels like it needs complexity, prefer clearer prompts, tighter ranges, or a
different interaction pattern before adding more PG logic.
</p>

<h2>How this chapter fits the book</h2>
<p>
Chapter 2 exists because every PGML problem still needs some PG scaffolding (<a href="/@go/page/488659">macros</a>, variables,
answers). The goal is to keep that scaffolding short, readable, and reusable.
