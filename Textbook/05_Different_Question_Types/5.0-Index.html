This chapter is the bridge between WeBWorK authoring and using WeBWorK inside ADAPT. It collects
common question interaction patterns (question types) and pairs them with a practical workflow and
a short QA checklist so you can ship reliable assignments without surprises.
</p>
<p>
Most biology and biochemistry prompts start as a story with a single decision, a short label, or
a short workflow. If the grading needs robust math parsing, multiple equivalent forms, or
algorithmic variants, use PGML-first WeBWorK. If the task is recognition, labeling, or a short
protocol step check, these interaction types are usually faster to build and easier to maintain.
</p>
<p>
Instructors usually lose time in two places: blank binding mistakes and generic error testing
loops. Use the <a href="/@go/page/555722">workflow and QA page</a> as the default finishing step,
even when a question looks correct in author view.
</p>

<p>
WeBWorK problems are authored using PG (a Perl-based setup layer) and PGML (a markup layer for the
student-facing prompt). In this guide, PG is treated as minimal scaffolding and PGML is the
default authoring style.

<p>
Life-science-first emphasis: examples and checklists are written to answer "what breaks when the
content is biology?" and to prioritize patterns that grade reliably for biology-style prompts.
For advanced techniques such as colored emphasis, table layouts, and matching with two-column
displays, see <a href="/@go/page/488663">Chapter 6</a>.
