This page combines a practical ADAPT workflow checklist with a compact QA pass for biology-style
WeBWorK items. The goal is to give you a repeatable routine that turns "generic error" screens
into specific fixes before you publish to students.
</p>
<p>
Treat previewing as a scientific replication step: same inputs should give the same result, and
failures should be reproducible. For a systematic approach to testing and common pitfalls, see
<a href="/@go/page/555731">Testing and Debugging</a>. First pass should be fast and local to get line-level
errors and sweep variants, then final pass should be in ADAPT to confirm student view and
assignment behavior. If a platform only reports "error," that is a signal to change the testing
tool, not to guess.

<h2>Workflow: clone, edit, preview, assign</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Start from a working question (clone or copy a trusted template from the OPL, see
		<a href="/@go/page/557378">OPL Header and Metadata</a> for OPL metadata).</li>
	<li>Edit one small thing at a time: story text, values, answer checker, or prompt structure.</li>
	<li>Preview and revise until the student view and grading are stable.</li>
	<li>Add the question to an assignment and confirm ordering and point values.</li>
	<li>Publish, then spot-check student view for the assignment context.</li>
</ol>

<h2>QA: variants, blanks, text variants, units, plausibility</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Variants</strong>: preview multiple variants and watch for impossible biology and awkward rounding.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Blanks</strong>: confirm each blank is bound to the intended answer checker and that blank order matches
		prompt order.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Text variants</strong>: decide what you accept for plural/singular, hyphens, spacing, and case (gene and
		protein naming is a common trap).
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Units</strong>: prevent unit drift (&mu;M vs mM, &mu;L vs mL) and restate expected units next to the blank.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Plausibility</strong>: constrain random ranges (no negative concentrations, no unrealistic pipette
		volumes).
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Log-scale traps</strong>: state the model and reporting format for pH, Ct, and fold change.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recommended testing loop</h2>
<ul>
	<li>First pass: use local rendering to get line-level errors and to sweep variants quickly.</li>
	<li>Final pass: use ADAPT preview to confirm permissions, assignment behavior, and student view.</li>
</ul>
