<p>
This section introduces core question types used across many assessment systems. These are often
useful for concept checks, terminology, and simple workflows that do not require WeBWorK-style
answer parsing or algorithmic randomization.
</p>

	<p>
	In this textbook, question types are treated as a practical authoring skill: you learn the patterns
	in Chapter 5, and then <a href="/@go/page/488663">Chapter 6</a> shows how to apply those patterns in
	specific scientific subjects.
	</p>
<p>
Use Multiple Choice when there is one best scientific claim and you can write distractors that
represent real misconceptions. Use Multiple Answer when the concept is a set and you can define
the set boundaries clearly. Use Matching for term-to-meaning mapping, Fill in the Blank for short
labels with controlled variants, and Ordered List only when the sequence is truly standard in
your context.
</p>
<p>
Life science questions fail in predictable ways: naming conventions drift, unit prefixes drift,
and prompts quietly allow more than one interpretation. When that risk is high, prefer
recognition-style items with explicit wording, or switch to WeBWorK answer checking where you can
enforce structure.
</p>

<h2>How this fits a PGML-first course</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Use WeBWorK (PGML-first) for numeric and formula-based practice where robust parsing and
		answer checking matters.
	</li>
	<li>
		Use these question types for portable, simple interaction patterns (multiple choice, matching,
		ordering, fill-in-the-blank).
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supported question types</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="/@go/page/555715">Multiple Choice (MC)</a></li>
	<li><a href="/@go/page/555716">Multiple Answer (MA)</a></li>
	<li><a href="/@go/page/555717">Matching (MATCH)</a></li>
	<li><a href="/@go/page/555718">Numerical Entry (NUM)</a></li>
	<li><a href="/@go/page/555719">Fill-in-the-Blank (FIB)</a></li>
	<li><a href="/@go/page/555720">Multi-Part Fill-in-the-Blank (MULTI_FIB)</a></li>
	<li><a href="/@go/page/555721">Ordered List (ORDER)</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Science prompt style (recommended)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Keep the story stable and short.</li>
	<li>Use explicit numbers and units in the prompt when relevant.</li>
	<li>Prefer tables for data instead of long prose when the problem is data-driven.</li>
	<li>For concept checks, write distractors that reflect common misconceptions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Input conventions</h2>
<p>
Each type is defined by a small set of inputs. The next sections show a science example for each
type using those inputs.
