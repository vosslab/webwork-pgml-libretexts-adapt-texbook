WeBWorK delivers automatically graded questions to students through a web interface.
As an author, you write a text-based problem file (usually a <code>.pg</code> file) that defines
values, a prompt, answer blanks, and grading rules.
</p>

<p>
A single problem can randomize values, present structured data, collect student answers, and grade
them immediately. In this guide, regular PG is treated as the setup layer and PGML is treated as
the student-facing prompt.
</p>

<h2>PGML-first rule of thumb</h2>
<p>
WeBWorK problems are written in a language called PG, but most authors should treat "regular PG"
as the plumbing that sets up variables and answer checkers. The student-facing prompt should be
written in PGML (PG Markup Language), which is designed to replace older <code>BEGIN_TEXT</code>
authoring.
</p>
<p>
Rule of thumb: if it is a sentence the student reads, it belongs in PGML.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		PG (minimal): load macros, choose contexts, define random values, and build MathObjects.
	</li>
	<li>
		PGML (primary): write the prompt, math, tables, and answer blanks using readable markup.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why it works well for life sciences</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Short prompts with structured data (tables, concentrations, rates, and units).</li>
	<li>Algorithmic variants for repeated practice without reusing the same numbers.</li>
	<li>Clear answer checking via MathObjects (numeric, formulas, lists, and recognition checks).</li>
	<li>Clean prompts for common biology patterns (dilutions, fold change, and small data tables).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apply it today</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Write one prompt sentence in PGML and move any student-facing text out of regular PG.</li>
	<li>Pick one biology-native pattern (a dilution, a rate, or a fold change) and randomize only the numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Next step: read Section 1.2 to decide when a prompt belongs in WeBWorK and when a simpler tool is a better fit.
