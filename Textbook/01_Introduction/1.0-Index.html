<p>
There are plenty of guides for writing mathematics assessment questions in WeBWorK. This guide
takes a different approach and is written for people in the sciences and other descriptive fields,
especially in the life sciences.
</p>

<p>
This book assumes you want questions that read like real lab and lecture tasks, grade reliably,
and are easy to reuse across semesters.
</p>
<p>
This book assumes you are a domain expert, not a software developer. The patterns shown here are
designed so that you can reason about biology first and let the templates handle the mechanics.
</p>

<p>
This guide is based on the PG 2.17 subset used in ADAPT and webwork-pg-renderer, so some macros
from full WeBWorK installs are not available. Use the macro allowlist reference in <a href="/@go/page/488658">Sections within a PG question</a>
before you try to load new interaction macros.

<h2>What this guide emphasizes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		PGML-first authoring: write the student-facing prompt in PGML and keep regular PG as short
		setup code for values and answer checking.
	</li>
	<li>
		Life-science style prompts: short narratives, concentrations and dilution workflows, structured
		data, and interpretation questions that match how biology is taught and practiced.
	</li>
	<li>
		Practical reuse: stable patterns you can clone and copy-edit to build question banks quickly
		without breaking grading.
	</li>
	<li>
		Subset-aware authoring: the ADAPT and webwork-pg-renderer PG 2.17 subset lacks some macros, so
		check the allowlist in <a href="/@go/page/488658">Sections within a PG question</a> before adding new interaction types.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apply it today</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Pick one page that matches what you are building today and copy-edit the example rather than starting from scratch.</li>
	<li>Keep regular PG minimal and write student-facing sentences in PGML.</li>
