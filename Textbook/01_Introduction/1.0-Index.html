<p>
There are plenty of guides for writing mathematics assessment questions in WeBWorK. This guide
takes a different approach and is written for people in the sciences and other descriptive fields,
especially in the life sciences.
</p>

<p>
This book assumes you want questions that read like real lab and lecture tasks, grade reliably,
and are easy to reuse across semesters.

<h2>What this guide emphasizes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		PGML-first authoring: write the student-facing prompt in PGML and keep regular PG as short
		setup code for values and answer checking.
	</li>
	<li>
		Life-science style prompts: short narratives, concentrations and dilution workflows, structured
		data, and interpretation questions that match how biology is taught and practiced.
	</li>
	<li>
		Practical reuse: stable patterns you can clone and copy-edit to build question banks quickly
		without breaking grading.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you want a quick vocabulary reset before you start, use Chapter 1.5 for the common terms used
throughout the book.

<h2>Apply it today</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Pick one page that matches what you are building today and copy-edit the example rather than starting from scratch.</li>
	<li>Keep regular PG minimal and write student-facing sentences in PGML.</li>
</ul>
