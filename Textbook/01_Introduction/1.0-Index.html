<p>
There are plenty of guides for writing mathematics assessment questions in WeBWorK. This guide
takes a different approach and is written for people in the sciences and other descriptive fields,
especially in the life sciences.
</p>

<p>
This book assumes you want questions that read like real lab and lecture tasks, grade reliably,
and are easy to reuse across semesters.
</p>

<h2>What this guide emphasizes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		PGML-first authoring: write the student-facing prompt in PGML and keep regular PG as short
		setup code for values and answer checking.
	</li>
	<li>
		Life-science style prompts: short narratives, concentrations and dilution workflows, structured
		data, and interpretation questions that match how biology is taught and practiced.
	</li>
	<li>
		Practical reuse: stable patterns you can clone and copy-edit to build question banks quickly
		without breaking grading.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to use this book (quick start)</h2>
<p>
This guide is organized as short pages you can read out of order. Pick the path that matches what
you are doing today.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		First win: start with Chapter 1.5 and copy-edit a complete PGML-first problem, then preview a few variants.
	</li>
	<li>
		Setup conventions: read Chapter 2 and adopt the minimal PG scaffolding pattern for new files.
	</li>
	<li>
		Prompt writing: go to Chapter 3 for PGML patterns such as blanks, lists, and tables.
	</li>
	<li>
		One complete example: read Chapter 4 to see how preamble, setup, prompt, and solution fit together in a single file.
	</li>
	<li>
		Interaction choice: use Chapter 5 as a catalog when you are deciding between multiple choice, matching, numerical entry, or fill-in-the-blank.
	</li>
	<li>
		Biology-first patterns: use Chapter 6 for common life science templates such as dilutions, kinetics, gels, qPCR, and pedigrees.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apply it today</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Pick one page that matches what you are building today and copy-edit the example rather than starting from scratch.</li>
	<li>Keep regular PG minimal and write student-facing sentences in PGML.</li>
</ul>
