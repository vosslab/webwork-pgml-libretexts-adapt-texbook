<p>
This quickstart is designed to give you a complete win early: take a working PGML-first problem,
copy it, and make a small edit that still grades correctly.
</p>

<h2>Quickstart steps</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Copy a working template problem (start from Chapter 4 if you have one available).</li>
	<li>Change only the story text first, keeping the variable names and math intact.</li>
	<li>Preview multiple variants to confirm the prompt still makes sense.</li>
	<li>Then change the numbers or the formula, one small change at a time.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Do not start by changing variable names or answer objects; change text first.
</p>

<h2>A minimal PGML-first skeleton (for copy-editing)</h2>
<p>
The file below is intentionally complete and minimal: it includes macros, setup, a PGML prompt,
and an answer blank tied directly to its answer object.
</p>
<pre>
DOCUMENT();

loadMacros(
	"PGstandard.pl",
	"MathObjects.pl",
	"PGML.pl",
	"PGcourse.pl",
);

Context("Numeric");

$a = random(2, 8, 1);
$b = random(3, 9, 1);
$ans = Real($a + $b);

BEGIN_PGML
In a lab notebook, two counts were recorded: [$a] and [$b].

What is the total count?

[`Total = `] [________]{$ans}
END_PGML

ENDDOCUMENT();
</pre>

<p>
After you can copy-edit a problem like this without breaking grading, you are ready to expand into
tables, multi-part prompts, and tighter answer checking.
</p>

<h2>Apply it today</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Copy a working file, change one small thing, and preview multiple variants before changing anything else.</li>
	<li>Keep student-facing sentences in PGML and keep regular PG focused on values and answer checking.</li>
	<li>After copy-editing, preview in ADAPT, and if ADAPT reports only a generic error, use Chapter 7 (webwork-pg-renderer) to get a line-level error and fix it fast.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Next step: use Chapter 2 to adopt a consistent file structure, then use Chapter 4 as your first reusable template.
