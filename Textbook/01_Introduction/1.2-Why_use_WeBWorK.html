<p>
WeBWorK is useful when you want repeated, low-friction practice with immediate feedback and
consistent grading. In science courses, the strength is not "more math", but rather repeatable
workflows for concentrations, dilutions, rates, fold change, and small data tables inside
realistic prompts.
</p>

<h2>Choose WeBWorK when</h2>
<ul>
	<li>You want repeated practice with immediate feedback and consistent grading.</li>
	<li>You want algorithmic variants where only the numbers change, not the story.</li>
	<li>You want explicit answer checking (tolerances, formats, and controlled text variants).</li>
	<li>You want prompts that mix text, values, and structured data without fragile formatting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Choose something else when</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The task depends on rich interaction that is better served by a dedicated widget or simulation.</li>
	<li>The assessment is primarily writing or multi-step reasoning that is not a good fit for auto-grading.</li>
	<li>You need a standardized export/import workflow and accept the constraints of an LMS package format.</li>
</ul>
<p>
WeBWorK is a good fit when you want students to calculate, interpret, or compare values, but a
poor fit for long written explanations or diagram drawing.
</p>

<h2>Why PGML matters</h2>
<p>
While a WeBWorK problem is "a PG file", this guide discourages writing long blocks of text in
regular PG. PGML is designed so that the prompt reads like the rendered output, and answer blanks
can be tied directly to answers in the same place you write the question.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Readable prompts with inline and display math.</li>
	<li>Answer blanks like <code>[_____]{...}</code> that stay close to the text they grade.</li>
	<li>Variable substitution that formats MathObjects correctly in TeX or calculator notation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Science-friendly patterns</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Use a short narrative plus a table of measurements.</li>
	<li>Ask for one computed quantity with clear units and controlled rounding.</li>
	<li>Include one or two recognition checks (multiple choice or matching) when appropriate.</li>
	<li>Prefer small, constrained randomizations over complicated logic.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tradeoffs to be honest about</h2>
<ul>
	<li>There is setup cost (macros, contexts, and answer checkers), especially for new authors.</li>
	<li>Randomization needs constraints and previewing, or you will generate broken variants.</li>
	<li>Format decisions (units, rounding, accepted text variants) must be stated to avoid grading disputes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apply it today</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Pick one life-science workflow (a dilution, a rate, or a fold change) and write the prompt in PGML.</li>
	<li>Write down the reporting rule (units and rounding) next to the answer blank.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How WeBWorK compares (briefly)</h2>
<p>
Other systems can also deliver automated questions (for example H5P interactive content,
standardized LMS-import item packages, and LMS-native quiz questions). The main reason to choose
WeBWorK in a science course is
when you want robust answer parsing and checking (MathObjects), repeatable algorithmic variants,
and clear, readable prompt authoring via PGML.
