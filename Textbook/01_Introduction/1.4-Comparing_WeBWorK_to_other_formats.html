Many platforms support automated or semi-automated assessment. The goal of this section is not to
rank tools, but to help you choose the right tool for the learning outcome and the workflow you
want for students and instructors.

<h2>Why WeBWorK is a good fit for sciences</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Science-style prompts</strong>: short narrative plus explicit numbers, units, and
		often a small table of data.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Robust answer checking</strong>: MathObjects parse student input and can enforce
		format, tolerances, and domain restrictions.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>PGML for readability</strong>: the prompt is written in a markup style that stays
		close to what students see, which helps maintainability.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Safe randomization</strong>: randomize values while keeping the story and scoring
		rules stable.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Choose WeBWorK when</h2>
<ul>
	<li>You want multiple algorithmic versions of the same question.</li>
	<li>You want students to enter values or formulas in a structured way.</li>
	<li>You want to grade based on meaning, not only string matching.</li>
	<li>You want to reuse and version-control questions as text files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Choose something else when</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		The learning outcome depends on rich interaction that is better served by a dedicated widget
		(platform-specific drag-and-drop, hotspots, complex UI interactions).
	</li>
	<li>
		You need a standardized export/import workflow and are comfortable with the constraints of
		the target LMS.
	</li>
	<li>
		The assessment is primarily writing or multi-step reasoning where auto-grading is not the
		main goal.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>A practical hybrid approach</h2>
<p>
Many courses mix tools:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use WeBWorK for numeric and formula-based practice with clear feedback.</li>
	<li>Use interactive activities for concept exploration or lab technique simulations.</li>
	<li>Use writing tools or projects for synthesis and communication skills.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This book focuses on WeBWorK with a PGML-first workflow. Treat regular PG as minimal setup code
needed to support a clear PGML prompt.
