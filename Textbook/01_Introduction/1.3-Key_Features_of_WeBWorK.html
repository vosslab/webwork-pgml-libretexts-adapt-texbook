<p>
WeBWorK's power is not a single feature, but a stable combination: algorithmic question setup,
structured answer checking, and readable authoring of the student prompt.
</p>

<h2>What matters for authors</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		PGML for prompt authoring (recommended): readable markup, math delimiters, and answer blanks
		(see <a href="/@go/page/488660">Chapter 3</a>).
	</li>
	<li>
		MathObjects for robust parsing and checking of student answers (numeric, formulas, lists).
	</li>
	<li>
		Randomization primitives (e.g., <code>random()</code>) to generate variants while keeping the
		scoring rules identical (see <a href="/@go/page/555727">Section 6.5</a>).
	</li>
	<li>
		Multiple answer interaction types via macros (numeric answers, formulas, radio buttons, etc.).
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you are new, focus first on PGML, numeric answer checking, and fixed-seed previewing
(see <a href="/@go/page/555731">Chapter 7</a> for testing and debugging);
everything else can wait.
</p>
<p>
Use this page as a checklist when you plan a new problem so you do not overbuild the setup.

<h2>What matters for life-science prompts</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Prompts that mix words, values, and math without fragile escaping.</li>
	<li>Tables for small datasets (measurements, lanes, conditions) in a readable format.</li>
	<li>Common biology workflows such as concentrations, dilutions, rates, and fold change.</li>
	<li>Clear expectations about units, rounding, and accepted formats to reduce grading disputes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tradeoffs and constraints</h2>
<ul>
	<li>There is setup cost (macros, contexts, and answer checkers), so templates matter.</li>
	<li>Randomization needs constraints and previewing to avoid broken variants.</li>
	<li>Auto-grading is only as clear as your reporting rules (units, rounding, accepted text variants).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apply it today</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Pick the interaction first, then keep setup minimal and write the student-facing prompt in PGML.</li>
	<li>Write one biology-native task (a dilution, a rate, or a fold change) and decide the reporting rule up front.</li>
</ul>
