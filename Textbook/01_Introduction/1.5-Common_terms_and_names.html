<p>
This page defines the short list of terms you will see repeatedly in this book. The goal is to
make the later chapters easier to read without stopping to decode vocabulary.
</p>
<p>
The terms are grouped into authoring terms and platform terms. Do not memorize these; return here
when a term blocks your progress.
