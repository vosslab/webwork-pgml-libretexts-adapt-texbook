<p>
This page defines the short list of terms you will see repeatedly in this book. The goal is to
make the later chapters easier to read without stopping to decode vocabulary.
</p>
<p>
The terms are grouped into authoring terms and platform terms. Do not memorize these; return here
when a term blocks your progress.

<h2>Open Problem Library (OPL): value and gaps</h2>
<p>
The Open Problem Library (OPL) is a large public set of WeBWorK problems that is invaluable for
learning common patterns, macro combinations, and interaction styles. It is also a reality check
for what question types exist in the wild and how authors structure PG and PGML.
</p>
<p>
Our 2026-01-17 corpus audit of the full OPL found that the subject mix is dominated by math and
that there are no life_sciences DBsubject tags, with bio-ish term hits showing up in only about
0.3% of files. That means the OPL is not a strong source of life-science problem content, even
though it is a rich source of structure.
</p>
<p>In this book, we use the OPL to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Spot reliable PGML patterns and macro combinations.</li>
	<li>Set realistic expectations for interaction types and widget choices.</li>
	<li>Build safer authoring checklists that avoid legacy patterns.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>When a term is unfamiliar, return here before you change macros or grading rules.</li>
	<li>Use a fixed seed to reproduce any issue you need to debug.</li>
</ul>
