<p>
Without WeBWorK-specific documentation, AI agents fall back on their general Perl training data
and write code that looks syntactically correct but fails inside the PG sandbox. Curated reference
documents prevent this. The analogy is straightforward: you would not hand a lab technician a set
of reagents without a protocol and expect a reliable result. The same principle applies to AI
agents. As one practitioner put it: "all the documents it needs is in the skill. So please don't
search my hard drive."
</p>

<p>
This page explains what knowledge documents are, introduces a ready-to-install skill that
contains them, describes what those documents cover, and shows how to build your own set if you
prefer to customize.
</p>

<h2>Skills and forums: same idea, different names</h2>
<p>
Different AI agents use different terminology for the same concept: a curated collection of
reference documents that the agent reads before it starts writing code.

<h2>The WeBWorK Writer skill (ready to install)</h2>
<p>
The fastest path for most users is to install a pre-built skill that already contains curated
WeBWorK authoring documents. The webwork-writer skill is publicly available and maintained
alongside this textbook.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Claude Code install (one command):</strong>
</p>
<pre>
claude plugin add https://github.com/vosslab/vosslab-skills/vosslab-skills:webwork-writer
</pre>
<p>
<strong>GitHub repository:</strong> The source documents are hosted at
<code>https://github.com/vosslab/vosslab-skills/tree/main/skills/webwork-writer</code>
</p>
<p>
<strong>For Codex users:</strong> Download the reference documents from the same GitHub repository
and add them to a forum in the Codex interface.
</p>
<p>
The skill contains approximately ten reference documents covering PGML structure, common mistakes,
macro allowlists, renderer API usage, CSS-based color and emphasis, advanced randomization,
matching problems, niceTables, linting rules, and OPL header metadata. Installing this single
skill gives the agent everything it needs to write most WeBWorK problems correctly, with no manual
document assembly required.
</p>

<h2>Why agents need WeBWorK-specific documents</h2>
<p>
PG looks like Perl, but it is not standard Perl. Agents trained on general Perl code will
confidently use patterns that break inside the PG sandbox. Here are the most common traps:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>PG runs in a sandbox that blocks most Perl builtins. Calls to <code>open</code>,
	<code>system</code>, and <code>die</code> will fail silently or throw errors.</li>
	<li>The <code>my</code> keyword breaks radio buttons and checkboxes. PG scoping rules differ
	from standard Perl, and lexical variables declared with <code>my</code> become invisible to
	the answer evaluator.</li>
	<li>Backslash references like <code>\@array</code> behave differently inside PGML than in
	regular Perl.</li>
	<li>PGML is single-pass. You cannot nest PGML commands or use Perl control-flow statements
	(like <code>if</code> or <code>for</code>) inside a <code>BEGIN_PGML</code> block.</li>
	<li>Standard HTML tags are blocked in PGML. Use CSS classes injected via
	<code>HEADER_TEXT</code> instead.</li>
	<li>Colors must use CSS, not TeX <code>\color{}</code> commands. The TeX color commands are
	escaped before MathJax processes them.</li>
	<li>Only PG 2.17 macros are available. Newer Perl modules are not loaded in the renderer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Without documentation that explains these differences, agents will hit every one of these traps.

<h2>What the skill documents cover</h2>

The following table lists the topics included in the webwork-writer skill. Think of this as a
table of contents for what is already inside the skill rather than a list of documents you need to
assemble yourself.

<h2>Building your own document set</h2>
<p>
If you want to customize the reference material or use an agent that does not support skills,
you can assemble your own document set. Keep these guidelines in mind:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Keep all documents in a single directory so the agent does not search your entire
	filesystem. A dedicated folder like <code>webwork-docs/</code> works well.</li>
	<li>Include an explicit instruction in your agent configuration: "Use only the provided
	documents. Do not search for other files."</li>
	<li>Start with a minimal set and add documents only as you encounter gaps. Four documents are
	enough to get started: a PG authoring guide, the common mistakes list, the macro allowlist,
	and the renderer API reference.</li>
	<li>When you find a new trap or pattern, add it to your documents instead of relying on the
	agent to remember it from a previous conversation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The textbook pages listed in the table above are a good source for building your own documents.
You can adapt their content into plain-text or Markdown files that your agent can read.
</p>

<h2>Apply it today</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Install the webwork-writer skill with one command:
	<pre>
claude plugin add https://github.com/vosslab/vosslab-skills/vosslab-skills:webwork-writer
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Test with a simple problem. Ask your agent to write a multiple-choice question about your
	favorite color. If the agent produces a working PG file that renders without errors, the
	skill is installed correctly and the agent can find the documentation.</li>
	<li>Once the skill is confirmed, move on to
	<a href="/@go/page/557416">Connecting AI Agents to the PG Renderer</a> so the agent can
	compile and test its own output automatically.</li>
</ul>
