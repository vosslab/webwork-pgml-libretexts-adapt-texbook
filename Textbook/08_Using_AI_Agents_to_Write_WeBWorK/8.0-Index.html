<p>
AI coding agents can write WeBWorK PG problem files for you, so you can focus on your subject
expertise instead of learning Perl syntax. Think of it like directing a trained lab technician: you
describe the experiment you want, and the technician carries out the procedure. You still need to
know what a good result looks like, but you do not need to pipette every reagent yourself.
</p>

<p>
Since late 2025, several AI coding agents have become capable enough to produce working WeBWorK
problems from a plain-language description. This chapter walks you through choosing an agent,
giving it the right reference material, connecting it to a local renderer so it can test its own
output, and refining your prompts to get better problems with less back-and-forth.

<h2>Start here</h2>
<ul>
	<li>If you have never used an AI coding agent, start with <a href="/@go/page/555730">What are AI Agents?</a> to understand what they are and pick one that fits your setup.</li>
	<li>If your agent writes code that does not render correctly, read <a href="/@go/page/557415">Knowledge Documents for AI Agents</a> to give it better reference material, then <a href="/@go/page/557416">Connecting AI Agents to the PG Renderer</a> so it can test its own output before you review it.</li>
	<li>If your agent already produces working problems but you want better results, go to <a href="/@go/page/557417">Advance AI Agents Advice</a> for prompt-engineering techniques and refinement strategies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
	<li>A running PG renderer on your local machine (see <a href="/@go/page/555732">Setting Up the PG Renderer</a>).</li>
	<li>Basic understanding of WeBWorK problem structure (see <a href="/@go/page/488655">Problem Generation (PG)</a>).</li>
	<li>An AI coding agent installed on your computer (see <a href="/@go/page/555730">What are AI Agents?</a> for options and installation links).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apply it today</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Use the decision table above to jump directly to the section that matches your current goal instead of reading the chapter front to back.</li>
	<li>If this is your first time, install an agent from the list in <a href="/@go/page/555730">What are AI Agents?</a> and try asking it to write a simple multiple-choice question about your favorite color to confirm the workflow end to end.</li>
</ul>
