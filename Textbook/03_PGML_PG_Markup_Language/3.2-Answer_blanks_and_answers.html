<p>
Answer blanks are the center of most WeBWorK problems. In PGML, blanks are written as
<code>[_____]</code> and the correct answer can be attached immediately after the blank using
braces. For the full catalog of question types that use answer blanks, see
<a href="/@go/page/488662">Chapter 5</a>.

<p>
<strong>Use this when:</strong> you want the grading rule to be obvious and close to the prompt
text students read.
</p>

<h2>Copy and edit</h2>
<pre>
$value = Real(12);
$answer = Real(24);

BEGIN_PGML
You measure a stock with [`c = [$value]`] mM.
What is twice the concentration?

Report your answer in mM:
[`2c = `] [____]{$answer} mM
END_PGML
</pre>

<p><strong>Common failure and fix</strong></p>
<pre>
Broken: [`ATP = `] [_____]{$ans2}
Fix: [`ATP = `] [_____]{"ATP"}
</pre>

<p>
Many examples online define answers far away from the text that students see. That pattern works
for short math problems but becomes fragile in biology-style prompts with multiple parts and
narrative flow. Attaching each answer directly to its blank keeps the grading logic aligned with
the story and makes later edits much safer.
</p>

<h2>Text answers in biology</h2>
<p>
Text answers are common in biology (gene/protein names, labels, or categories). Keep the accepted
strings narrow and document what counts as correct to avoid over-accepting.
</p>
<pre>
Context("String");
Context()->strings->add(
	ATP => {},
	atp => { alias => "ATP" },
	adenosine_triphosphate => { alias => "ATP" }
);

BEGIN_PGML
The molecule is [_____]{"ATP"}.
END_PGML
</pre>

<h2>Expression and formula blanks</h2>
<p>
If the correct answer is a formula, use a quoted string or a Formula MathObject.
</p>

<pre>
$f = Compute("x^2-1");

BEGIN_PGML
[`y = `] [________________]{$f}
END_PGML
</pre>

<h2>Why attach answers to blanks</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The grading rule stays next to the text that asks for it.</li>
	<li>Multi-part science prompts are easier to maintain.</li>
	<li>It reduces the chance of mismatching answer order and prompt order. For common answer blank mistakes and how to fix them, see <a href="/@go/page/555733">Section 7.2</a>.</li>
</ul>
