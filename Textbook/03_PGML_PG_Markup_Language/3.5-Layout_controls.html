<p>
Layout controls can improve readability for longer prompts, but fragile formatting is one of the
fastest ways to create problems that render differently across systems. Prefer simple structure
(headings, lists, and tables) and treat layout controls as an optional finishing touch.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Use this when:</strong> a prompt needs clearer scanning after the grading is already
stable.
</p>

<h2>Copy and edit (minimal structure recipe)</h2>
<pre>
BEGIN_PGML
# Data
Measured values are shown above.

## Tasks
1. Compute the rate in s^-1.
2. Report the final value with units.

### Report
[`Rate = `] [____]{$rate} s^-1
END_PGML
</pre>

<p><strong>Common failure and fix</strong></p>
<pre>
Broken: *Measure* *_everything_* *carefully* and *report* *everything*.
Fix: Report the value in *mM* to *two decimals*.
</pre>

<h2>Headings (structure)</h2>
<p>
Headings help students scan a multi-part prompt. In PGML, headings are written with
<code>#</code> characters at the start of a line.
</p>

<pre>
BEGIN_PGML
# Data
## Tasks
### Report
END_PGML
</pre>

<h2>Emphasis (bold and italic)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Bold: <code>*bold*</code></li>
	<li>Italic: <code>_italic_</code></li>
	<li>Bold italic: <code>*_bold italic_*</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
Use emphasis to highlight the task being asked and the reporting expectations (units, rounding),
not to decorate the story.
</p>

<h2>Horizontal rules (sparingly)</h2>
<p>
Horizontal rules can separate major blocks, but headings are usually clearer.
</p>
<pre>
----
</pre>

<h2>Justification and centering (rare)</h2>
<p>
PGML supports simple right-justification and centering syntax. These are occasionally useful for a
short "report" block, but they can be fragile and are easy to overuse.
</p>

<pre>
BEGIN_PGML
>> Right-justified line

>> centered <<
END_PGML
</pre>

<p>
Layout controls are best used sparingly. If a formatting change affects how answers are entered,
checked, or interpreted, it is usually a sign that the structure should be simplified rather than
refined. Clear structure matters more than visual polish.

<ul>
	<li>If grading is failing, go back to Section 3.2.</li>
	<li>Need a data table students read from? Go to Section 3.4.</li>
	<li>Need computed inserts? Go to Section 3.6.</li>
</ul>
