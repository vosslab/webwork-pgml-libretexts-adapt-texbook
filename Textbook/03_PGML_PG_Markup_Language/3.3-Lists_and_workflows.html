<p>
Lists are one of the most useful PGML features for life science prompts because many tasks are
multi-step workflows. Use lists to make expectations scannable and to reduce "I missed that part"
errors.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Use this when:</strong> you want a lab-style sequence that doubles as a grading rubric.
</p>

<h2>Copy and edit</h2>
<pre>
BEGIN_PGML
You are preparing a PCR reaction. Follow these steps:

1. Compute the final primer concentration in &mu;M: [____]{$c_final}
2. Report the MgCl2 concentration in mM: [____]{$mg_final}
3. State whether the buffer is 1x or not: [____]{$buffer_ok}

Use the units shown in each step.
Round to two decimals.
END_PGML
</pre>

<p><strong>Common failure and fix</strong></p>
<pre>
Broken:
1. First step
Second paragraph without indent.
Fix:
    Second paragraph with four-space indent.
</pre>

<p>
In lab-style questions, lists are not just formatting. They communicate order, expectations, and
reporting structure to students. When you later revise a problem, changing list order often
requires checking that the associated answer blanks still match the intended step.
</p>

<h2>Numbered lists</h2>
<pre>
BEGIN_PGML
1. Compute the concentration.
2. Report the value with units.
END_PGML
</pre>

<p>
Start a numbered list item with a number, a period, and a space. PGML will renumber items in the
rendered output, so the specific numbers you type are not the important part.
</p>

<p>
To include a second paragraph within the same list item, indent the paragraph with four spaces.
</p>

<pre>
BEGIN_PGML
1. First step with a paragraph.

    This stays inside the first item.
2. Second step
END_PGML
</pre>

<h2>Bullet lists</h2>
<pre>
BEGIN_PGML
* Use the values from the table.
* Keep units consistent.
END_PGML
</pre>

<p>
Bulleted list items typically begin with an asterisk (<code>*</code>) or a dash (<code>-</code>).
</p>

<h2>Biology workflow example</h2>
<pre>
BEGIN_PGML
You are preparing a PCR reaction mix. Follow these steps:

1. Compute the final primer concentration in &mu;M.
2. Compute the final MgCl2 concentration in mM.
3. Decide whether the final buffer is 1x or not.
END_PGML
</pre>

<h2>Authoring notes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Keep each list item to one task.</li>
	<li>When a task requires a unit or a format, state it inside the list item.</li>
	<li>Use lists to make constraints visible (for example, "round to two decimals").</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Next, depending on what you are doing:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Need a single blank that grades correctly? Go to Section 3.2.</li>
	<li>Need a data table students read from? Go to Section 3.4.</li>
	<li>If grading is failing, go back to Section 3.2.</li>
</ul>
