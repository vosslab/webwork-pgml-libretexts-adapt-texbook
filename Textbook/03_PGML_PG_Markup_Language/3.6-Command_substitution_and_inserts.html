<p>
Command substitution lets you run a small Perl expression and insert its output into the PGML
prompt. This is useful for inserting images, computed strings, or helper-generated markup.
</p>
<p>
Command substitution is powerful, but it should not be the first solution to a formatting or
clarity problem. In most cases, PGML lists, tables, or explicit text are easier to read and
easier to maintain. Use substitution only when the content genuinely depends on computed or
conditional output.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Use this when:</strong> you need to insert computed output or helper-generated markup that
PGML cannot express directly.
</p>

<h2>Copy and edit</h2>
<pre>
$ct = Real(21.2);
$rows = [
	[ "Sample", "Ct (cycles)" ],
	[ "Control", 18.2 ],
	[ "Treatment", 21.2 ],
];

BEGIN_PGML
[@ DataTable($rows, caption => "qPCR results") @]*
The Ct for Treatment is [____]{$ct}.
END_PGML
</pre>

<p><strong>Common failure and fix</strong></p>
<pre>
Broken: [@ DataTable($rows) @]
Fix: [@ DataTable($rows) @]*
</pre>

<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre>
[@ some_perl_expression() @]
</pre>

<p>
If the substitution produces output that is already formatted as PG/HTML, follow it with a star:
</p>

<pre>
[@ some_perl_expression() @]*
</pre>

<table class="mt-responsive-table">
	<colgroup>
		<col style="width: 50%;">
		<col style="width: 50%;">
	</colgroup>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Use it for</th>
			<th>Avoid it for</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td data-th="Use it for">Computed intermediate values or helper-generated tables.</td>
			<td data-th="Avoid it for">Basic formatting that PGML already supports.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td data-th="Use it for">Reusable PG helpers that return formatted output.</td>
			<td data-th="Avoid it for">Simple text that can be typed directly.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Common uses</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Insert a computed intermediate value into a worked solution line.</li>
	<li>Insert a table or figure generated by helper functions.</li>
	<li>Use a specialized PG helper when PGML does not provide a direct syntax.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example: computed text inside math mode</h2>
<pre>
BEGIN_PGML
To solve [: x + [$a] = [$b] x :], subtract [:x:] from both sides to get
[: [$a] = ([$b]-1) x = [@ $b - 1 @] x :].
END_PGML
</pre>

<h2>Images and links (LibreTexts constraint)</h2>
<p>
Images can be inserted via helper functions and command substitution, but the textbook content in
this repository avoids HTML links because LibreTexts provides its own table of contents and
in-platform navigation. Keep prompts self-contained and do not rely on linking out to other pages.
</p>

<p>
Treat this as an advanced escape hatch: keep substitutions small, readable, and easy to test.
