# Changelog

## 2026-01-12
- Tightened Chapter 2 to treat minimal PG as an explicit contract (PG is setup, PGML is the prompt), added a
  life-science-first mindset checklist, updated the minimal template to a dilution-style prompt, and labeled advanced
  macros as recognition-only.
- Tightened Chapter 1 pages to use a more consistent page structure (short opener, decision-oriented sections, and an
  "Apply it today" closer) while keeping content aligned with `Textbook/TEXTBOOK_PAGE_SUMMARIES.md`.
- Filled previously-empty Chapter 7 local-testing pages to match `Textbook/TEXTBOOK_PAGE_SUMMARIES.md` and to restore
  a clean `tests/run_html_lint.sh` run.
- Updated `README.md` into a clearer landing page and corrected the chapter entry-point paths to match the current
  `Textbook/` layout.
- Aligned Chapter 1 HTML pages with `Textbook/TEXTBOOK_PAGE_SUMMARIES.md` by adding a quick-start/navigation section
  to `Textbook/01_Introduction/1.0-Index.html` and tightening the Chapter 1 feature and quickstart pages.
- Added `docs/CODE_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/FILE_STRUCTURE.md` to document the repo workflows, components, and
  directory layout.
- Rewrote `README.md` as a stable repository overview and authoring guide (LibreTexts constraints,
  chapter map, editing workflow, and validation commands).
- Expanded `README.md` with repository layout, topic coverage, and usage guidance
  based on the Insight-HTML exports.
- Replaced `README.md` with the chapter expansion plan for the `Textbook/` guide.
- Removed autogenerated `Textbook/00_Front_Matter/` and `Textbook/99_Back_Matter/` folders to
  avoid confusion about where editable content belongs.
- Filled previously-empty chapter HTML files and expanded existing chapter pages with PGML-first,
  science-focused guidance using the local Insight/WebWorK HTML archives as source material.
- Added `tools/html_lint_checker.py` (lxml-based) and `tests/run_html_lint.sh` to lint textbook HTML
  for LibreTexts compatibility (no links, no JavaScript).
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with the repo intent (textbook/guide) and the HTML authoring constraints.
- Updated `README.md` plan to reflect the no-link rule and removal of front/back matter.
- Added a new Chapter 1 comparison page and a brief comparison section in Chapter 1.2 to position
  WeBWorK against other autograded formats (H5P, LMS packages, quiz banks, etc.).
- Updated the Chapter 1.4 comparison table to use LibreTexts responsive table markup while keeping
  explicit column widths.
- Added `docs/LIBRETEXTS_HTML_GUIDE.md` documenting the standard LibreTexts-compatible table format
  and other HTML authoring rules for `Textbook/`.
- Documented the requirement that every `X.0-Index.html` chapter index ends with
  `<p>{{template.ShowOrg()}}</p>` and updated all chapter index files to include it.
- Removed explicit subsection filename lists from `Textbook/06_WeBWorK_for_Different_Subjects/6.0-Index.html`
  to avoid link-like navigation in LibreTexts and rely on `{{template.ShowOrg()}}` instead.
- Added Chapter 5 question type subsections with science examples for MC, MA, MATCH, NUM, FIB,
  MULTI_FIB, and ORDER.
- Refocused Chapter 6 back to subject-specific guidance that assumes the Chapter 5 question types.
- Added `Textbook/TEXTBOOK_PAGE_SUMMARIES.md` with page summaries for each `Textbook/` HTML page.
- Updated `Textbook/TEXTBOOK_PAGE_SUMMARIES.md` to use three human-readable sentences per page and
  to avoid the words "learning", "objective", "outcome", and "goal".
- Added a short "SEO tags" list to the third sentence of each page summary in
  `Textbook/TEXTBOOK_PAGE_SUMMARIES.md`.
- Rewrote `Textbook/TEXTBOOK_PAGE_SUMMARIES.md` to vary sentence openers while keeping the
  three-sentence structure and the stable "Use it ..." third sentence.
- Moved the `Textbook/TEXTBOOK_PAGE_SUMMARIES.md` SEO tags onto a separate line under each entry.
- Expanded the `Textbook/TEXTBOOK_PAGE_SUMMARIES.md` guideline language to better match the intended
  three-sentence structure while avoiding formal jargon.
- Updated `Textbook/TEXTBOOK_PAGE_SUMMARIES.md` SEO tags to be intentionally short (aiming for ~3
  tags per page, allowing fewer or more when it helps).
- Shifted `Textbook/TEXTBOOK_PAGE_SUMMARIES.md` SEO tags away from repeated global terms and toward
  page-specific, index-like topics.
- Reorganized the textbook chapter layout by adding a Chapter 1 quickstart and splitting question
  types into `Textbook/05_Question_Types/` with life-science-first examples and checklists.
- Expanded `Textbook/02_Problem_Generation_PG/2.2-PG_Problem_Files_with_a_pg_file_extension.html`
  with a five-section structure guide and an annotated PGML-first skeleton.
- Expanded `Textbook/02_Problem_Generation_PG/2.4-Common_PG_Macros.html` with advanced macro topics
  frequently referenced in older problems (algorithmic and InexactValue-related patterns).
- Condensed the PGML chapter to a smaller set of focused subsections under
  `Textbook/03_PGML_PG_Markup_Language/` and updated the chapter index accordingly.
- Updated the worked example in `Textbook/04_Simple_Problem_Example_in_WeBWorK/4.0-Index.html` to a
  PCR mix concentration calculation (life-science lab context).
- Integrated ADAPT workflow notes and QA guidance into Chapter 5 via
  `Textbook/05_Question_Types/5.9-ADAPT_workflow_checklist.html` and
  `Textbook/05_Question_Types/5.10-QA_and_common_failures.html` and removed the separate
  `Textbook/07_*` through `Textbook/13_*` standalone chapter folders to keep the main chapter list
  compact.
- Added Chapter 6 subject-specific subsections with a biology-first pattern catalog (dilutions,
  kinetics, genetics mapping, pathways, gels/blots, qPCR Ct, pedigrees, and experimental design).
- Added `Textbook/90_Appendices/90.5-Advanced_patterns_and_further_techniques.html` as a curated
  "further techniques" section (strings in context, data tables, custom feedback, and scaffolding).
