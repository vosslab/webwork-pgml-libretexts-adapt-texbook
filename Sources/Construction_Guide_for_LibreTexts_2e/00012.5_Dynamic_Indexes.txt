12.5: Dynamic Indexes

Once a book or course has been compiled (i.e., added to the Download Center with PDFs and LMS common cartridge files
available), the book will have a Front Matter and Back Matter automatically generated. The Back Mater will have a "Index" page
that is is a dynamic index that is constructed by the meta-tags of the pages of the book.

For example, the index for Wakim and Grewal's Human Biology text can be access here:

https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Human_Biology/Book%3A_Human_Biology_(Wakim_and_Grewal)/zz%3A_Back_Matter/1
0%3A_Index

You can see the term "abiotic factors" in the index at the top.

Section 24.2 is automatically added to the index under "abiotic factors" since that term was manually added to that page's Tags (in

Page settigs).

WHAT THE ...?

You can certainly be excused for not recognizing the red-tipped organisms in Figure 24.2.1. They were not even discovered until 1977
Figure 12.5.2: Meta-tags for Section 24.2 showing the tag "abiootic factors" has been manually added.

Since there are seven other meta-tags indicated for this page, it will be reflected multiple times in the index.
