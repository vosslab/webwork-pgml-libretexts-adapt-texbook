Oibretexts:

The width of the thumbnails for books should be 500 pixels and for chapters 250 pixels. You can set this with Windows Paint
or appropriate UNIX or Apple tools. Large thumbnails slow down page loading and hog storage.

To remove a page thumbnail, hover over the thumbnail image in Page settings and click the Delete (X) icon.

All thumbnails should be openly licensed. Two sources are pixabay.com and pexels.com discussed in Section: Image Resources.
The source and Creative Commons license of the thumbnail should be written in book or chapter text, usually at the bottom as
