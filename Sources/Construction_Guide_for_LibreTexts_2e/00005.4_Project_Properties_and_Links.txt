After the book has been created the Project Page looks like the image on the left below and if you press the Textbook Link you will
see the new book you created. It has the required Front Page, (Title, open license statement, Table of Contents and summary CC
licensing for the book) and Back Matter (Index, Glossary and Detailed Licensing). Should these be deleted or damaged an
Administrator can rebuild them for you. The First Chapter has no content and is simply a place holder before Remixing.
