12.3: More Advanced Typesetting Standards

One of the strengths of the Libretexts project is that all pages share similar formatting so it is easy to mix content from different
sources. This page contains general formatting rules.

e h1 is reserved for page/chapter/book titles

e All section headings should use h2, h3, etc ...

e All text should be full justified.

e All number lists should use the CKE list options, this also includes bullets
e Erase all indentations

e Try to avoid underlines (use bold or italic instead)

e Full justify all text (it is automatic, but can be overwritten)

e Format figures

e Make sure all equations are in MathJax, do not import as images

e Where possible, there should be universal adoption of SI units and formatting. To a large extent SI formatting has already
been adopted by the contributors to LibreTexts. I note a few exceptions below.

e The energy of activation is preferably abbreviated as E,, not Ea.

e Spaces should be inserted in long numbers, for example, 34 500 J/mol is preferred to 34500 J/mol.

e Spaces should be included between numbers and units. For example, 273 K is preferred to 273K.

e Use the degree symbol when describing degrees Celsius. For example, 25 °C is preferred to 25 C.

e Where 'sec' is used, change to 's'.

Figure Coding (ADVANCED)

While images can be added to pages directly as discussed previously, we have a more advanced system for tying a figure caption to
the figure. For now, this is added by selecting the "AddFigureCenterCenter" template.

Insert template x

Templates:

CrossTransclude '

CrossTransclude
EmbedJupyterConfiguration
Template:AddFigure lSnterRight
Template:AddHiddenText
Template:BoxDefinition

~- Template:BoxExample lame
Template: BoxExercise
Template:BoxNote

Template: BoxSkills
Template:BoxTheorem
Template:Embed ChemWriter
Template:Embed Query
Template:Embed3Dmol
Template:EmbedGLmol
Template:EmbediCn3D
Template:EmbedJSmol
Template:EmbedJupyter
Template:PageIndex

Once the template is embedded, there will be two spots to add the image and the caption.

--- Page Break ---

Oibretexts:

This <figure> system is the HTMLS code for semantic representation of images. This allows us to tie in the figure caption to the
figure so that they cannot be broken (e.g., by a page break in printing PDFs). It has several additional benefits as well. It acts as a
that we can control over the entire site via CSS which allows for a standardization - this applies to the <figcaption> text that is tied

to the <figure> code. It also provides a semantic background for the image so that Google and others can tie the figcaption to the
figure.
