Note: Imported Courses are automatically set to Private. To allow other instructors to have access to the assignments of your newly
important course, you have to select Public on the course properties page. Student information is never sharable.

¥ Duplicating Courses

If you want to duplicate an existing course on your account, you need to "import" that course (from your account into your
account).

Course View

The top level of the ADAPT is an overview of your courses that includes a link to access the course, a toggle switch to allow
students to view the course (and its assignments and assessment), the course start and end date and some options.
