14.8: Interfacing ADAPT to LMS via LTI

In terms of the URL, they all look the same except for the final parameter. For example, if you go to:
https://adapt.libretexts.org/Iti/canvas/config/my-super-cool-college

you'll find "my-super-cool-college" within their config information. The reason for this, is ADAPT consumes the final parameter to
know which school it is and sends them back to the correct Canvas authorization endpoint.

Also, once they go to the URL and fill out the form, I get an email with how they set it up and then I connect with them for the final
steps (basic testing of the connection). So, feel free to pass out the URL with the last parameter to be changed to their college (or
some abbreviation):

https://adapt.libretexts.org/Iti/canvas/config/wwu

or

https://adapt.libretexts.org/Iti/canvas/config/western-washington-university

would be some good examples.
