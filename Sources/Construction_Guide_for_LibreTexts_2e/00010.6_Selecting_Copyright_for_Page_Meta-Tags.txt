Figure 10.6.1: Full page settings for Chemistry library. Each library has a different set of meta-tags. The licensing options for pages
are selected via a pull down menu.

Selecting the appropriate license requires more discussion about the nature of the license.

Avoid adding any content into the Libretexts that has a ND license on it. These do not play well with the community remixing
aspect of the LibreTexts project. There are a few texts with this annoying license on the platform, but not many.
