Gibretexts-

12.1: Harvesting Workflows
Development of content in the LibreTexts platform proceeds via five mechanisms operating in parallel:

e Mechanism 1: Student contribution from scratch (e.g., via extra credit)

e Mechanism 2: Student integration of existing content outside the LibreTexts platform from faculty and experts
e Mechanism 3: Faculty construction of raw content from scratch

e Mechanism 4: Faculty integration of existing content outside the LibreTexts platform from faculty and experts
e Mechanism 5: Faculty and student re-editing of content already existing on the LibreTexts (with permission)

Modules from all five mechanisms are processed through a sophisticated vetting structure, involving students and faculty (see
below), to eventually guarantee reliable, fully-vetted content that is capable of substituting for that found in current paper-based
textbooks. Content from higher ranked mechanisms typically supersedes content from lower ranked mechanisms, resulting in the
continual evolution of the LibreTexts content.

There is a range of different workflows possible for constructing texts and selecting the best workflow is an individualize or team
decision. There are tools to facilitate construction efforts with the Remixer as most powerful.

Harvesting project follow different workflows depending on the nature of the content and the nature of the format of the content.
Below are several established workflows that may be followed in harvesting projects.

Oibretexts:

From Word

Mechanism I

e Pull PDF into Google doc (first upload
pdf to Google Drive, then select "Open
in Google Doc")

e Follow Google Doc workflow

Mechanism IT

e Build the empty Text Skeleton

e Copy & Paste content into each page
individually

e Clear formatting as needed since word
generates messy code)

e Edit and typeset pages as needed

e Use Mathpix for OCRing equations as
needed

e User GrindEQ to convert MS equations
to latex

From Latex Source

e Build the empty Text Skeleton

e Use Pandoc to convert latex source
code to html/mathjax code
o The command line code to use is

"pandoc --mathjax -t htm15 input.tex
-O output.txt"

e Copy & Paste content into each page
individually (as html source instead of
GUI front end)

e Edit and typeset pages as needed

From EPUB3

Direct Importer under development

e Pull into EPUB reader and follow
Website workflow

From Google Doc

Mechanism I

e Convert to EPUB file

e User LT Importer to import EPUB file
(admin use only)

e Edit and typeset pages as needed

Mechanism IT

e Build the empty Text Skeleton

e Copy & Paste content into each page
individually

e Edit and typeset pages as needed

e Use Mathpix for OCRing equations as
needed

From Pressbooks

Mechanism I (if EPUB export option is

available)

e Export text into EPUB

e User LT Importer to import EPUB file
(admin use only)

e Edit and typeset pages as needed

Use Mathpix for OCRing equations as

needed

Mechanism II (if EPUB export option is

not available)

e Import into LT Pressbooks instance
(admin use only)

e Export text into EPUB

e User LT Importer to import EPUB file
(admin use only)

e Edit and typeset pages as needed

e Use Mathpix for OCRing equations as

needed

From XML
Direct Importer under development

From EPUB/Common Cartridge

e User LT Importer to import EPUB file

e Edit and typeset pages as needed

If the EPUB is unvalidated (poorly
constructed), then the LT importer will not
generate all pages and will push chapter
content into single pages. If this happened,
then user Remixer (in remix mode) to flesh
out the text generated from the Importer
(e.g. add relevant pages).

From Lumen (modified Pressbooks)

Lumen platform is really a Pressbooks

platform slightly modified with no export

options (OER content is fettered).

e Import into LT Pressbooks instance
(admin use only)

e Export text into EPUB

e User LT Importer to import EPUB file
(admin use only)

e Edit and typeset pages as needed

From Pretexts
Requires admin access to the importer to
harvest.
