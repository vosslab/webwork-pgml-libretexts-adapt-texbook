1.4: Course Shell Checklist

The LibreTexts project currently consists of 16 inter-operating libraries. The OER content of each library is stored within a single
hierarchical tree, so that individual textbooks are part of the whole rather than independent entities. The top level of this
hierarchical tree for each library consists of two primary trunks viewable on the top landing page of the respective library:

The textbooks within the Bookshelves are centrally curated, as are the Homework Exercises and Learning Objects. The Course
Shells area holds campus- and faculty-specific course areas. Each course shell is uniquely designed to address the needs of faculty
and their students. Students and faculty can directly access their class activities here.

¥ Terminology: Textbooks, Remixes, and Textmaps

There are specific terms that are required to be defined:

e Textbooks are original (all or mostly) OER texts and are identified by "Book:" in their titles. This is the traditional
definition of a textbook that was constructed by one or a small team of authors with the collection of these books reflecting
a traditional library or bookstore. These are stored in the Bookshelves trunk of the hierarchical tree.

e Remixes are texts generated (in part or completely) from existing content, often with customized content interspersed.
These are usually stored in the Campus Bookshelves trunk of the hierarchical tree in areas identified by institution.

e Textmaps are specialized remixes that are constructed to follow the organization of existing commercial textbooks.
Textmaps facilitate adoption by faculty that are switching from a commercial textbook to an OER alternative; these texts
are identified by "Map:" in their titles. These are stored in the Bookshelves trunk of the hierarchical tree.

Step 1: Identify the Library

Identify the library (or libraries) in which you want to create a course shell. There are 14 independently operating libraries on the
LibreTexts platform and currently all of them require just one single independent authentication (i.e., account). This account can be
made at the LibreOne hub. The ADAPT homework system is discussed later and has a separate account with separate access
credentials. More information about the Commons/LibreOne and the login process, you may jump ahead to the page on the
Conductor tools.

Step 2: Instructors Account

Anyone can view all content available on LibreTexts, you only need an account if you want to publish your own customized
course. You single LibreOne login will work on all of the libraries, but you should ensure you are logged in to the library where
you want to store your text, although you can reuse content across all libraries in your remix. Request an instructor's account here.
To register you will have to provide an Email account and a password. We greatly prefer that those registering for an instructor's

account use an institutional email (for example .edu or .org in the US). We will also ask for a URL where it is clearly shown that

https ://chem.libretexts .org/@go/page/483686



--- Page Break ---

Oibretexts:

you are an instructor. This URL must be open for us to see the content and not require a userID/pwd. Instructor accounts are
usually approved within a few days.

Step 3: Project Management and Book Creation

When you log in with your instructor's account you will have access to the Libraries and the Conductor Tool. This is described later
in the manual. Using the Project Management tool you can create a Project and in one click create a rudimentary book shell which
you will build out into your custom text. To complete building the structure of your book you access the Remixer from the
Conductor

Step 4: Create an Empty "Book" for a Course

You will use the Remixer to set up the structure of the entirety of the "book" you will build. This will be described later in detail.
We put the term book in quotes because it is really a course shell where you can organize all of your course materials, but behind
the scenes, it is just a complex book with different sub-books.

While the organization of a course shell can vary, they almost always have a "Text" which is typically a remix of existing material
that was customized for the instructor for whom the course shell was made. Here are some examples of advanced course shells:

em_110A%3A_Physical_Chemistry_I_(Larsen)

e https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Sacramento_City_College/SCC%3A_Chem_309_-
_General%2C_Organic_and_Biochemistry_(Bennett)

and a simplified course shell (consisting of only a remixed text):

_Introduction_to_General_Chemistry

Step 4: Create a Text

Step 5: Customize and Edit Remix

Now that you have created your course shell and remix, you can customize as needed. This often requires direct editing of pages -
see Construction Guide for details:

e https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Remixer_University/Construction_Guide/2%3A_Basic_Editing

You can make changes to your remix by simply going to the remixer again, either from the Project page (best) or from the book
itself.

Step 6: Publishing

Once you are satisfied with your course shell it is ready to be moved to your Campus Hub so your students can access it. Until we
get publish function implemented this will have to be done by an administrator, contact us at info@libretexts.org to publish.

Every campus can publish 5 course shells (across all libraries combined) without joining the LibreTexts Network.
