CHAPTER OVERVIEW

8: Basic Editing

The LibreTexts libraries are powered by the Mindtouch system. An exhaustive set of references for the tools on this powerful
system can be found online at https://success.mindtouch.com/Author/Editor. The pages below summarize a subset of these tools
that are useful in day-to-day use of the LibreTexts project.

# An Instructor's account allows editing capability on essentially all pages in the library

e The wiki infrastructure of the LibreTexts makes it difficult to break anything. So feel free to experiment, play around, and
test things out.

e All edits are saved as revisions. You can always revert to any older revision via the "Revision history" button under
"Options"

e All edits get sent to the LibreTexts development team for eventual review (not approval).

e You can sign up with your personal account to "Watch" page(s) if any edits occur (using the little star next to forward/back
right below the page title).
