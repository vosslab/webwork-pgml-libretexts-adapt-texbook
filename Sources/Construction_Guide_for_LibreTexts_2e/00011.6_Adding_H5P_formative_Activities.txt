11.6: Adding H5P (formative) Activities

LibreTexts content can be enhanced with interactive HSP technology (https://h5p.org/). On this page we will discuss how this
technology operates formatively (i.e., without a gradebook) within the LibreTexts platform. LibreText Adapt can be used to make
H5P problems into summative activities. The H5P activities are stored on a dedicated Wordpress server, not on the Library servers.
Embedding an activity into a LibreTexts page is a three-step process:

Step 1: Create or locate the activity

Browse the LibreStudio server (https://studio.libretexts.org) to see if there may already be an H5P activity that you can use. If your
credentials do not allow logging into the server, consult the LibreTexts development team for access (info@libretexts.org).

You can also upload the desired activity into the HSP LibreStudio server. There are many public domain H5P activities on the H5P
project server and elsewhere that you may find useful and want to import into LibreStudio to use in a LibreText.

And in the likely event you cannot find a problem that does exactly what you have in mind, you can create your own problem in
LibreStudio! See the H5P project site (https://h5p.org/) for full instructions on this process, and look at example problems to get
ideas.

Step 2: Copy the ID Number of the desired activity

Once you have created an H5P activity, look for the HSP ID number. Click on the activity and the following information should be
displayed on the right. Note the H5P ID at the bottom of this list.

H5P ID

Step 3: Insert ID Number into H5P Template on page
The H5P template lets authors embed the H5P activity into a page (page > elements > template).

¥ Template:Adapt x
Template:AddAudio
Template: AddFigureSingle
Template: AddHiddenText
Template: AddMultiFigureMultiCaption
Template: AddMultiFigureSingleCaption
Template:BoxDefinition
Template:BoxExample
Template:BoxExercise
Template:Boxinteractive Cancel
Template:BoxNote
Template:BoxObjectives
Template:BoxQuery
Template:BoxTheorem
Template:BoxWarning
Template:ChemCollective
Template:Embed3Dmol
Template:EmbedGLmol
Template:EmbediCn3D
Template:EmbedJSmol
Template:Pageindex
Template:QueryiMath
Tomplate:QueryWebWork

Once the template is added to the page, all you have to do is change the ID number of the activity here to the one you located in
Step 2 (in the place of 5 in below template).
