6.1: Applying for an Instructor's Account

Let's start by walking through the process of registering for an instructor's account and creating a new book. Start at
https://one.libretexts.org. If you have an account you can go directly to signing on, if not you will have to register. To register you
will have to provide an Email account and a password. We strongly prefer that those registering for an instructor's account use an
institutional email (for example .edu or .org in the US).
