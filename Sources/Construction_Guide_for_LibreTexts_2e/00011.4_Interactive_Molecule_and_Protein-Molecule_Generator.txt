11.4: Interactive Molecule and Protein - Molecule Generator
The seven steps (from start to finish) for embedding interactive proteins/molecules via the molecular generates are:

e Step 1 (Prepare the image)

e Step 2 (Copy Code)

e Step 3 (Navigation and Edit)
e Step 4 (prepaste)

e Step 5 (paste)

e Step 6 (save and tag)

e Step 7 (refresh)

Step 1: Prepare the image

Step 1 (Prepare the image): Go to
https://bio.libretexts.org/Visualizations_and_Simulations/Molecular_and_Protein_Interactive_Figures/Molecule_Generator

and organize how you want the image to go. Since you will probably want proteins most, select "Wwww.rcsb.org PDB ID" under the

option (see red arrow in image below).

Molecule Generator

For molecules enter its common or IUPAC name.
If it does not show up try to find it at https://pubchem.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/ or for proteins at https://www.rcsb.org/ to find a molecule ID number.

common or IUPAC molecule name ' ae

ex. caffeine or 2-propanol

Show/Hide Help

Then you put in the PDB code you want. For example "3PYP" for my favorite protein. That pops up the full menu of options
including the way the interactive figure will look. Tweak with the options as you like (most are obvious).

Step 2: Copy Code
Step 2 (Copy image code): Press the blue button "Copy GLmol to Clipboard" (see red arrow in image below).

Steps 3 & 4: Navigate, Edit and Prepaste
Step 3 (Navigation and Edit): Go to the LibreTexts page you want to embed that code and "edit" the page.

Step 4 (prepasting): In the spot you want the image to go to "style" and click on "Dekiscript" to add a block to the code.

For liquids, the specific rotation may be obtained using the neat liquid rather than a solution; in such cases the formula is
[a] D temp (neat)= a Ixd
where ais the observed rotation, / is the path length of the cell (measured in decimetres, dm), and d is the density of the liquid
Identifying and distinguishing enantiomers is inherently difficult, since their physical and chemical properties are largely identical. Fortunately, a nearly two hundred year old

discovery by the French physicist Jean-Baptiste Biot has made this task much easier. This discovery disclosed that the right- and left-handed enantiomers of a chiral compound
perturb plane-polarized light in opposite ways. This perturbation is unique to chiral molecules, and has been termed optical activity

Plane-polarized light is created by passing ordinary light through a polarizing device, which may be as simple as a lens taken from polarizing sun-glasses. Such devices
transmit selectively only that component of a light beam having electrical and magnetic field vectors oscillating in a single plane. The plane of polarization can be determined by
an instrument called a polarimeter, shown in the diagram below.

Monochromatic (single wavelength) light, is polarized by a fixed polarizer next to the light source. A sample cell holder is located in line with the light beam, followed by a

Steps 5 and 6: Paste and Tag
Step 5 (paste): Paste the code that was saved in step 2 from your clipboard to the red Dekiscript block under "Enter Dekiscript")

Step 6 (save and tag): Save the page, and under page settings (it may be expanded or not) you will see a "Embed GLmol" option
(see red arrow below)

The organization of the page settings is not standardized across the libraries; the one above is for chemistry and biology is
organized differently, but find the proper tag and switch it to "yes"

Step 7: Refresh
Step 7 (refresh): Refresh the page (e.g., F5 on PCs) and be amazed at the embedded protein in your page.
