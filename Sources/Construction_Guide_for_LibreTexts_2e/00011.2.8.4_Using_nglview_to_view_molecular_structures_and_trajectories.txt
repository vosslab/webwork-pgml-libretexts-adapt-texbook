11.2.8.4: Using nglview to view molecular structures and trajectories

The package nglview can be used to generate and render complex molecular visualizations. These can be explored with the mouse
by dragging to move the view and scrolling to zoom in/out.

Because visualizations can quickly become complex, it is recommended to check out the documentation of nglview to get a full
grasp of how to use it.

An example is shown below:

import nglview as nv

view = nv.show structure file(nv.datafiles.PDB)

view
restart restart & run all
