5.1: Conductor Home

You have to have an instructor's account to access the Conductor. If you have logged in to from the commons (discussed in the
previous chapter) or go directly there, you will see the Rocket page from which you can go to any of the libraries or the
applications for which you have permissions. The tool symbol at the upper right of each card shows that you require separate logins
for those applications (ADAPT, JupyterHub and NOVA). If you do not have permissions for any of the others this will be shown by
a NoGo symbol in the same location on the card.

In most cases you want to go to the Conductor first. Users will see a fairly simple page. Administrators will see a more complicated

display which will be discussed later.

Greetings, LibreTexts Community! Did you know we
offer a variety of in-person and virtual professional
development opportunities? AND if you're affiliated

Going left to right at the top of the page, Home is where you are, Projects takes you to projects you are working on, and Analytics
takes you to the Analytics area for courses you have registered. LibreTexts Analytics allows instructors to explore measurements of
their students' interactions with LibreTexts open access content in order to gauge understanding of course content and identify
potential areas of improvement. You will have to register your course and students to enable this feature. Analytics features are still
in beta testing so patience may be required. There will be further discussion of Analytics in Chapter 10.

Harvest Requests are requests for integration of external OER that you would like to see integrated into LibreTexts, either for direct
use or use in custom LibreTexts. The queue can be very long and we appreciate patience and any help you can provide. Priority is
given to LibreTexts Network institutions. We also try to prioritize integrating OER texts that people are ready to adopt in their
classes.

Adoption Reports are your telling us that you are using a LibreTexts resource in your classes.

Instructor Verification Requests reports the status of your verification request made when you applied for an account. There are
also links to videos that will help you get started.

LibreTexts.org takes you to the home page of LibreTexts website
