Grader Feedback
There are a few options to send Grader's feedback to students:

e Plain Text - as the name states this feedback is just text, without any special formatting options
e Rich Text - gives Graders some formatting options, like cut, copy, undo, redo, bold, italic, underline, subscript and superscript
e Canned Response - allows Graders to save their feedbacks and apply them when grading other students. Very useful in
situations when you need to give the same feedback to several students. To use Canned Responses:
1. Select "Canned Response" as Grader feedback type
2. Click "Edit Responses"

Communicating with Students

Students can send questions about their grades or submissions to the Grader. Grader will receive an email similar to the one shown
in Figure 14.6.17 Grader can reply to the email directly or use the provided link that will take them to the grading section. The
question that the message was about will be brought up. From here the process is the same as during the first time grading. Score
can be updated or left the same, new feedback can also be added if needed
