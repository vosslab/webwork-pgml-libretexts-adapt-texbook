11.3: Interactive Molecules and Proteins - Direct Embedding
Our molecule adding video tutorial on YouTube: youtu.be/-Md0Y90LhyY

An interactive protein/chemical can be embedded into pages via the following steps. A more advanced Molecule Generator is
discussed elsewhere.

Step 1: Identify the page you want to edit
For example, let's say we want to edit this page:

https://bio.libretexts.org/TextMaps/Map%3A_Biochemistry_Free_and_Easy_(Ahern)/03%3A_Structure_and_Function/3.2%3A_Pr
oteins

and swap out the collagen image for an interactive image

Fibrous Proteins

Not all proteins have significant amounts of tertiary or quaternary structure. (As we shall see, these last two levels of structure arise from 'bends' in polypeptide chains and interactions
between separate polypeptide chains, respectively.)

Alpha keratin, for example, is what we refer to as a fibrous protein (also called scleroprotein). Alpha keratin has primary structure and secondary structure, but little tertiary or
quaternary structure.

Consequently, alpha keratin exists mostly as long fibers, such as are found in hair. Beta-keratin is a harder fibrous protein found in nails, scales, and claws. It is made up mostly of beta
sheets. Proline, which is the least flexible amino acid, due to attachment of the side chain to the alpha-amino grip, is less likely to be found in alpha helices, but curiously it is found
abundantly in the fibrous protein known as collagen. Collagen (previous page) is the most abundant protein in the human body and is the 'glue' that literally sticks us together. How does
the inflexibility of proline permit it to be in a helix? The answer is probably the parallel abundance in collagen of glycine, which contains the smallest side group and therefore has the
greatest flexibility.

As an interesting sidelight of the presence of proline in collagen is the chemical modification of prolines, by the addition of hydroxyl groups, after the protein is made. Such 'post-
translational modifications' are not uncommon. Threonine, serine, and tyrosine frequently have their hydroxyl side-chains phosphorylated. Lysines in collagen too are hydroxylated post-
translationally. The hydroxylated prolines and lysines play a role in the formation of interchain hydrogen bonds and crosslinking of triple helices during the assembly of collagen fibrils.
These bonds provide structural integrity to the collagen. The enzymes that add hydroxyls to proline and lysine require vitamin C (ascorbic acid) for their activity. Lack of vitamin C leads
to the production of weakened collagen fibrils, resulting in a condition called scurvy.

The carbonyl oxygen of the peptide bond can exist in resonance with the C-N bond, giving the peptide bond characteristics of a double bond and imposing limitations for rotation around
it. If we trat the peptide bond as a double bond, then the arrangements of adjacent carbon bonds around it can be thought of as being in the cis or trans configurations. In proteins, not
surprisingly, the preferred arrangement of these groups is strongly trans (1000/1). Of the 20 amino acids, the one that favors peptide bonds in the cis configuration most commonly is
proline, but even for proline, the trans isomer is strongly preferred.

Step 2: Identify the desired ID code

There are several ways, but best to just grab the PDB code. From the PDB, we can see the code we want is 1BKV:
