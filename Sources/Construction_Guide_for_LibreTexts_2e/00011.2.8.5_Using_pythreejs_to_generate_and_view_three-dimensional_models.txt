11.2.8.5: Using pythreejs to generate and view three-dimensional models

It is possible to use output from pythreejs in Libretexts pages. The examples below are taken from the pythreejs documentation and
are licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License.

Primitive 3D shapes can be constructed and viewed as follows. Click and drag to explore the shape.

from pythreejs import BoxGeometry
BoxGeomet ry (
width=5,
height=10,
depth=15,
widthSegments=5,
heightSegments=10,
depthSegments=15)

restart restart & run all

More complex shapes can be constructed and viewed as well:

from IPython.display import display

from pythreejs import (ParametricGeometry, Mesh, PerspectiveCamera, Scene,
MeshLambertMaterial, DirectionalLight, AmbientLight,
Renderer, OrbitControls, PerspectiveCamera)

fouun
function f(origu, origv, out) {
// scale u and v to the ranges I want: [0, 2*pi]
var u = 2*Math.PlI*origu;
var v 2*Math.PI*origv;

var = Math.sin(u);
var Math.cos(v);
var Math.cos(u+v);

.set(x,y,Z);

}
