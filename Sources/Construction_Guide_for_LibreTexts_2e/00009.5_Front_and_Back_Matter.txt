9.5: Front and Back Matter
The front matter and back matter are automatically updated on a weekly basis.

e The back matter does not have content in it yet for most books, but that is where authors can add glossaries and indexes. The
latter are dynamically constructed for textbooks. To add terms to the index, add metatages for each page on the page settings. To
build a rollover glossary edit the glossary page and add word/phrases and their definition to the table.

e The front matter always has three pages: titlepage, infopage, and table of contents. Other pages can be added like "preface",
"about the author", "about the book", "acknowledgments" etc. Authors have flexibility in this matter.
