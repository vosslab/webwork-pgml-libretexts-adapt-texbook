12.7: Publishing Protocol

To "publish" a book is a catch all phrase to represent the final step in releasing a newly constructed text for public consumption,
typically from an author/remixer's sandbox. This entails several steps to complete properly.

1. Confirm that the author/remixer's campus hub exists (and doesn't exceed 5 if the campus is not a LibreNet member). If the hub
does not exist, this requires creating one:

1. Go to "Courses" section of the library
2. Make a "New" page. Select Book/unit. Rename the new section to the campus name
3. Find the campus Logo online that works. Scale/crop it to 150 points vertical (e.g., with Paint) and add it to the newly
constructed (and empty) campus Hub's thumbnail in the Page Settings.
2. Go to the unpublished book in the author/remixer sandbox and move it to the new hub (under Options)
3. Once moved, then change the permission of the entire book by selecting "Restrict Access" under Options and then select Public
AND apply changed to all subpages.

© Overwrite all permissions on subpages to the settings on this page
4. To confirm the book is reasonably well put together, open up the Remixer in edit remix mode and run it (i.e., save to the
server). This is a general clean up step.

5. Under the top page of the book and only the top page select Set Cover Page/Add to Download Center under the Cover Page
options of the Page settings

6. The Cover specifications need to added to the top of the book (i.e., the designated Cover Page). This follows this format, which
is quite specific

lulu@CoverTitle@ CoverAuthor@CoverAffiliation@BinderTitle

7. Optional: It is always recommended that the author add some text into the Cover Page's Summary (in PageSettings) since that
goes on the back cover of the book

8. Optional (for LibreNet Members): The default logo on the back of the book is the LibreTexts "The Future is Open" logo.
LibreNet members have the rights to have their campus logo branded to the books from their campus. That requires uploading
the Institutional Logo section
(https://chem.libretexts.org/Under_Construction/Development_Details/Project_Icons_and_Logos/Institution_Logos) and then
adding a new metatag to the Cover Page

9. Compile the book (you need batchaccess via membership in this group to access this button. if you do not have this
membership, then the Compile button does not show up

10. The above procedure will create Front and Back matter sections, if they do not already exist. If the two sections are at the end of
the book (ei., the Front matter is not at the front), then you want to Unorder the top level of the book:

11. If the Unorder scrambles the order of the chapters, then run the remixer again to renumber the pages accordingly. (This is rare,
but happens from time to time). If you have to do this, then Compile the book again.

This workflow will handle most publishing efforts. The pages that are default in the Front Matter and Back Mater will be
automatically constructed including the TitlePage, the InfoPage, the Table of Contents, the Index (and soon to be the Glossary).
The TitlePage may require additional editing depending on author's desires.
