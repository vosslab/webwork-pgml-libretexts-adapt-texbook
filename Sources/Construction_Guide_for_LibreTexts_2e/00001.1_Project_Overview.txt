1.1: Project Overview

LibreTexts is a collaborative effort to improve education for students, especially economically-disadvantaged students, by
constructing and distributing open-access online LibreTexts libraries. The project includes complementary ancillaries that advance
a number of different pedagogical methods. It supports a highly diverse student population previously exposed to a broad range of
learning experiences and with major differences in their skill levels, preparation, and background. In addition to providing up-to-
date, peer-reviewed, affordable, and convenient content. LibreTexts, as a Next-generation learning system, promotes personalized,
flexible, and interactive learning experiences. From these components, we will have a combined assessment infrastructure that
tracks and correlates individual performance with simulations, homework activities, and exam performance with a goal of
identifying and tracking student strengths and weakness to determine how best to amplify learning across multiple curricula. This is
enabled by broad scope vertical and horizontal nature of the LibreTexts.

We recently hosted a You Tube webinar to explain our project and scope:

This Construction guide aids developers in interacting with the LibreTexts platform and building content. To complement these
resources, there is a Construction Forum for developers to help each other, which is freely available (however, a free account is
needed to post) (groups.io/g/Libretexts-ConstructionForum/topics):

The success of the LibreTexts Project positively impacts four groups in substantial ways:
(1) Availability of free quality resources for learning by the non-academic community;

(2) Reducing the financial burden on all students, especially lower socioeconomic status students, while simultaneously addressing
any identified lack of preparation;

(3) Smaller or financially disadvantaged academic institutions, including high schools, that increasingly wish to adopt newer
learning technologies but cannot afford the initial buy-in to change curriculum; and

(4) Discipline-based education researchers looking for a platform to evaluate interdisciplinary approaches and curriculum
modifications that would otherwise cost too much to develop from scratch.

(5) LibreTexts provides equal education opportunities to students with limited English proficiency by expanding the libraries into
other languages. Currently complete machne translated Spanish and Ukrainian libraries are available and there are smaller libraries
in French, Portuguese, Arabic, Hindi, Chinese and Kishwali.

Traditional publishing of a textbook involves preparing a typeset manuscript for a commercial publisher, who binds it and
distributes it, often at prices that make it inaccessible to students from less affluent institutions. However, online texts are superior
to a paper text in several ways:

1. Web browsers can jump to the page you click on, so even an 800 page book can be read in real time.
2. The equations, sections, references and index cross-referencing can be hyperlinked, so students can effortlessly jump back and
forth through the text.

3. Traditionally, there are conflicts between conciseness (i.e., important ideas get across within reasonable reading time) and
scholarly completeness. Online texts allow for branching into levels of detail suited to individual reader's interests, and
providing up-to-date links to other relevant material.

4. It is often more instructive to work through a solution of a problem than be given only the abstract theory. Online texts helps by
providing links to student projects and problem solutions.

It is possible to have LibreTexts books printed by print-on-demand companies (both Amazon and LuluExpress output files are
generated). A complete book takes often years to produce; however, the LibreTexts platform makes it possible to make accessible
the (semi)completed parts as textbook construction proceeds. The LibreTexts project adopts an open construction approach since
we strongly believe that is better to have educational content accessible to students and then continuously improve it, rather than
refusing to share until the building and perfecting is completed. Content on LibreTexts is either constructed from scratch or
harvested from existing OER content, but most of it is integrated from existing content scattered across the internet. Content stored
on individual faculty's websites, hidden in pdfs, or published has been integrated into the LibreTexts format, all with the original
author's permission to publish the content under a free license that aligns with the free and accessible philosophy of the LibreTexts.
Central to its success is the construction and adoption of faculty specific and freely accessible "LibreTexts" that substitute for costly
conventional textbooks in post-secondary courses. These are assembled by incorporating content from an extensive network of
existing chemistry and broader materials.

LibreVerse

The LibreTexts Libraries are part of a great "LibreVerse" of interconnected technologies to advance the development and usage of
the textbook of the future. Many aspects of this greater Libre Verse will be introduced in this Construction Guide.

Supporting the libraries are a number of components (most require instructor accounts to access and are unlinked below)

e ADAPT - LibreTexts' new homework system with integrated problem sets.

e Analytics - Linked to the Adapt homework system, LibreTexts' Analytics have been designed by instructors for their students.

e Studio - LibreTexts' H5P app for building questions that can be inserted into your LibreTexts.

e Nova - Drupal based FOSS tech allows local hosting of LibreTexts' with native H5P, QTI and other courseware features.

e Commons - LibreTexts' window on the world, access to Catalog, Libraries and Collections. Every LibreNet member has their
own branded Campus Commons.

e Conductor - LibreTexts' team oriented project management software coordinates book construction and curation.

e Composer - LibreTexts' drag and drop remixer for books. LibreTexts' editor provides paragraph level attribution, automatic
numbering of equations and more.

e Curator - LibreTexts' format allows centralized, automatic curation flagging common problems including lack of alt text,
linkrot and more.

e JupyterHub - provides an environment where you can create interactive notebooks with code, visualizations, and more.
