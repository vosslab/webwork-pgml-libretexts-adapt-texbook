Figure 8.4.1: How to add a table from the editing tool bar.

You can choose the number of rows and columns you need (can be changed later). This gives you an empty table structure that you
can start to fill out. If you want to delete a row, select an entry in the row you want to delete and click on the x that appears to the
left. If you want to add a row above or below, you can do that by clicking the > that appears above or below the x respectively.

If you are copying a table from a website you will likely be able to copy its structure via a
simple copy-paste. You can also add tables directly by copy-pasting a section of a
spreadsheet although this varies with the spreadsheet application you are using and the
complexity of the table. The same is true of tables in word processing applications

Right click on the table and select table properties. Here you can choose whether the first row and/or column is headings and add a

caption to the table. Making the first row/column headings is useful for screen readers and strongly recommended if possible.
Allow table to be responsive, this ensures proper viewing on all types of viewing devices.

# Always be Responsive

It is a good idea to select the "make table responsive" section (see Figure 8.4.2) of any new table so that it will be easily
viewable on mobile devices and computers.
