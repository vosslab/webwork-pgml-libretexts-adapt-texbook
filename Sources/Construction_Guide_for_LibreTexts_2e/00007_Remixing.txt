CHAPTER OVERVIEW

7: Remixing

The OER Remixer allows rapid assembly of customized Remixes from existing sources on our comprehensive and ever-growing
libraries. This Remixer Tutorial is a detailed explanation of the Remixer's interface and a walkthrough of how to do basic tasks
with the OER Remixer, as well as videos. Your Remixing Map is stored automatically on your computer as you build, so you do
not have to complete your Remix in one setting. The Remixer works best on Chrome browsers running on W10.

Before using the OER Remixer, it is important to construct a Remixing Map as described in Section 3.2. The gist of the map is to
identify the content in the libraries that will map into the organization of the new remix . This requires faculty/instructional
designers to peruse the Bookshelves of Source texts and of other Course Remixes to identify desired content. Once remixed, these
pages can be then edited at the sub-page level (e.g., sub-sections, paragraph, pages etc). The Remixing Map reflects only the initial
organization of a custom remix. Notice the customized organization; there is no limit other than imagination and the size/makeup
of the LibreTexts libraries. It is often necessary to make placeholder pages in the Remixer if a gap exists in the libraries. New
custom content can be added to these pages once the text is created.
