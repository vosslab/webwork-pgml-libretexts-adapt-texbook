Administrators and Team Leads. Project Liaisons are LibreTexts and Campus Network Administrators. When a book is created
from a Project, all team members can view the book in the library, Leads, Liaisons and members can edit the books. Auditors can
view it. There is a switch to the right of the form to allow people who are not using @libretexts.org accounts to be added. To add a
