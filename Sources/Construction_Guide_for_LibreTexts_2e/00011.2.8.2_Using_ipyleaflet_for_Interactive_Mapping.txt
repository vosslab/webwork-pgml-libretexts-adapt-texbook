11.2.8.2: Using ipyleaflet for Interactive Mapping

The ipyleaflet Jupyter package for Python allows you to use the powerful interactive mapping features of Leafletjs within Jupyter
and Libretexts documents. Here's a short example to demonstrate what can be done with ipyleaflet on Libretexts.

First we import the packages we'll need to use.

from ipyleaflet import Map, Heatmap
from random import uniform
import time

restart restart & run all

Then, we'll declare and display a map of the world.

m = Map(center=[0, 0], zoom=2)
m

restart restart & run all

Next, we can make a function to generate random heat maps and overlay them onto our existing map.

def create random data(length) :
"Return a list of some random lat/lon/value triples."
return [[uniform(-80, 80),
uniform(-180, 180),
uniform(0, 1000)] for i in range(length) ]

heat = Heatmap(locations=create random data(1000), radius=20, blur=10)
m.add_ layer(heat)

n restart restart & run all

Then, we can even animate it as follows:

for i in range(100):
heat.locations = create random data(1000)
time.sleep(0.1)

heat. radius = 30

heat.blur = 50

heat.max = 0.5

heat.gradient = {0.4: 'red', 0.6: 'yellow', 0.7: 'lime', 0.8: 'cyan', 1.0: 'blue'}
heat. locations = [[uniform(-80, 80), uniform(-180, 180), uniform(0, 1000)] for i in re

restart restart & run all
