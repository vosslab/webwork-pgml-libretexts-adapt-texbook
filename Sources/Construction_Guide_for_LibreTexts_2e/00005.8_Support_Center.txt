5.8: Support Center

The LibreTexts Support center is accessed through the large encircled blue question mark at the bottom of every page. Tickets are
generated through the Contact Support button. The knowledge base contains helpful links. The system is quite new, and more help
files are under construction. System status lets you know if problems are due to LibreTexts system or something else.
