8.5: Hyperlinking

Our hyperlink video tutorial on Youtube: youtu.be/gUId6IMItp8

To ensure effective coupling of pages within the LibreTexts, content on pages can be "hyperlinked" to other pages. This is a simple
process:

e Mark the word you want to be the hyperlink, then click the hyperlink button with the "chain link" icon.
e If you want to link to an outside page, place the address in the "link to" box and click "update link".

e If you want to link to an internal LibreTexts module, you can use the "browse" option to find the page. You can also use the
search function to look for key words (make sure you check that the page is a relevant link though).

DO NOT HYPERLINK OUTSIDE OF THE LIBRARY UNLESS NECESSARY. WHILE CURATING IS KEY TO THE
LIBRETEXTS PLATFORM, LINK FARMING (CURATING DEAD LINKS) IS TO BE AVOIDED.

If you select a section of the text you can insert a link in the Link to: box which appears in the dialog shown below. You can use the

browse box to find any section of any text in the library you are working in. If you are linking to another library you will have to
find the URL by exploring that library in another browser window.

Anchors

Links to other pages in LibreTexts will take you to the top of the page. You can set anchors which, together with the page URL will
take you to any location on the page. Headings are automatically set as Sections which are a special class of anchors, but you may
want to set an anchor next to an equation or an image, a table, or a special part of the text.

To do so place the cursor where you want to set the anchor, select Anchor from the Elements dropdown at the top of the Editor and
fill in a name for the anchor.

After an anchor has been set, when you are building a link to it you can select the Anchor from the list at the bottom of the Link
page where is says Jump to anchor or section:

You can, for example, set anchors next to each reference in a list, and then set a link in the text to that anchor where the reference is
invoked
