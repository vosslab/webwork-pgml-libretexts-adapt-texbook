<div class="prose !max-w-full"><p>No. Like other browser-based word processors, Antecedent automatically saves the document as you write. When you return, follow the same procedure that you followed to start writing the document. The document will be as you left it. However, if you like, you can download a version of the document to your local computer.&nbsp;</p></div>
