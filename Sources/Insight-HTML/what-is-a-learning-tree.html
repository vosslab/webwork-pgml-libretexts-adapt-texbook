<div class="prose !max-w-full"><p>A LibreTexts Learning Tree is an interactive assessment tool built into the LibreTexts platform that enables instructors and content creators to design hierarchical, adaptive question sets that respond to student input. These trees are structured to scaffold student understanding of complex topics, offering a low-stakes, feedback-rich environment that supports self-paced and adaptive learning within open educational resources (OER). Learning Trees are organized as node-based structures, where each node presents a question with multiple answer options. Depending on the student's response, the system directs them to a new node that either advances the concept, provides remediation if the answer is incorrect, or concludes the activity with feedback. This approach encourages deeper engagement and personalized learning pathways.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As with other forms of adaptive learning, Learning Trees are more than just traditional assessment tools-they are designed to guide students through conceptual understanding by providing instant feedback. Learners follow personalized pathways that branch according to their responses, creating a tailored and adaptive learning experience. Built and embedded using LibreTexts Studio, Learning Trees integrate seamlessly into LibreTexts books and support a variety of question types, including multiple choice, true/false, and short answer formats.</p></div>
