<p class="max-w-6xl"><span class="font-medium">Description</span>: <span class="italic">A Nursing Bow Tie question is an assessment format where learners analyze a clinical scenario and then connect three elements-client needs, nursing actions, and outcomes-into a "bow tie" structure.</span></p>
<div class="prose !max-w-full"><p>Nursing Bow Tie questioning is an assessment format used to evaluate clinical reasoning and decision-making. In this type of question, learners organize information into a "bow tie" structure that connects three key elements: client needs or problems, nursing interventions or actions, and expected outcomes. The center of the bow tie typically represents the central clinical issue, while the left and right sides represent interventions and outcomes, respectively. This format helps students visualize cause-and-effect relationships in patient care, reinforces critical thinking, and aligns closely with the problem-solving approach emphasized in nursing practice and NCLEX-style assessments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Write a question prompt and then add two correct Actions to Take, one correct Potential Condition, and two Parameters to Monitor. Each of these groups should have at least one Distractor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p></div>
