<div class="prose !max-w-full"><p>The WeBWorK system, originally developed by the Mathematical Association of America and the National Science Foundation, is an open-source online homework platform widely used in mathematics and related disciplines. Within the ADAPT homework system, WeBWorK serves as one of the integrated assessment engines, providing algorithmically generated problem sets with randomized values that ensure each student receives a unique version of a problem. This promotes academic integrity while allowing unlimited attempts with immediate feedback, supporting mastery-based learning. By embedding WeBWorK into ADAPT, instructors can draw from an extensive library of thousands of vetted math and STEM problems, customize assignments, and seamlessly deliver them alongside other interactive question types, giving educators and students a unified and flexible homework experience.</p><p>WeBWorK problems can be authored using two related coding systems: PG (Problem Generation) and PGML (Problem Generation Markup Language). PG is the original language, built on Perl with custom macros that handle randomization, answer checking, and math rendering. It is highly flexible and powerful but can be difficult to read and write, since it mixes Perl code, LaTeX, and formatting commands. To address this, PGML was developed as a more user-friendly markup layer on top of PG. PGML uses a Markdown-like syntax where authors can write text, include LaTeX math, and insert answer blanks or multiple-choice questions with simple, clean commands.</p><p>PGML is the preferred language to build WebWork questions in ADAPT. It is a simplified markup language to write and format math problems in a clean, readable way. It combines plain text with LaTeX-style math for equations, along with special commands for answer blanks, multiple-choice questions, and other interactive features. Unlike raw Perl coding in WeBWorK, PGML makes problem authoring more approachable by handling much of the underlying formatting automatically. For example, PGML automatically aligns equations, inserts answer boxes, and checks student input, allowing instructors to focus on problem content rather than complex code. It is now the preferred method for writing new WeBWorK problems.</p><p><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/adding-images-in-pgml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Adding Images in PGML</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/answer-blanks-in-pgml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Answer Blanks in PGML</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/command-substitution-in-pgml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Command Substitution in PGML</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/creating-horizontal-rules-in-pgml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Creating Horizontal Rules in PGML</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/emphasis-in-pgml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Emphasis in PGML</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/general-webwork-techniques" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>General WebWork Techniques</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/headings-pgml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Headings in PGML</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/indenting-centering-and-justifying" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Indenting, Centering, and Justifying</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/introduction-to-pgml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Introduction to PGML</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/justification-in-pgml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Justification in PGML</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/lists-in-pgml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lists in PGML</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/mathematical-notation-in-pgml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Mathematical Notation in PGML</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/pgml-webwork-sample-problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>PGML WeBWorK Sample Problem</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/tables-in-pgml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tables in PGML</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/variable-substitution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Variable Substitution in PGML</strong></a></p></div>
