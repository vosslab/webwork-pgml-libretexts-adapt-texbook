<div class="prose !max-w-full"><p>ADAPT learning trees are a graph-based approach to adaptive student learning. The tree is a collection of nodes that point to each other (a directed acyclic graph). Nodes can refer to a question, video, notes, or remarks about the contents of the tree. Trees comprise one root node, with branches of varying width and depth. Students first attempt a question associated with the root node. If the student answers the question incorrectly, they are directed to review one branch of the learning tree, to bolster their understanding. Students may attempt the root node question after completing a branch of the learning tree.</p><p>Videos</p><ul><li><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/learning-trees-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Learning Trees Overview</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/creating-a-learning-tree-assignment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Creating a Learning Tree Assignment</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/creating-and-editing-learning-trees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Creating and Editing Learning Trees</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/example-learning-tree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Example Learning Tree</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/student-view-of-learning-trees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Student View of Learning Trees</strong></a></li></ul></div>
