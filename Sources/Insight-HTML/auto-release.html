<p class="max-w-6xl"><span class="font-medium">Description</span>: <span class="italic">ADAPT's new auto-release system is designed to facilitate "releasing" of assignments to students. </span></p>
<div class="prose !max-w-full"><p>ADAPT's new auto-release system is designed to facilitate "releasing" of assignments to students. Released courses are viewable to students enrolled in the class. This is different from "opening" an assignment, which means that students can start submitting to questions in that assignment. The operating theme of the Auto-release tool is that the instructor will rely on ADAPT to release the assignment to students a fixed time before the assignment opens.&nbsp;</p><p>The Auto-release tool is designed to reduce students being overwhelmed if they see all the assignments of the class at the start of the class and it simplifies the instructors effort by removing the responsibility to manually release assignments. This can be daunting if a lot of assignments exist for the course.</p><p>The release status of assignments are indicated on the top level view of the course (see below) via the radio buttons under the "Released Status" column or via the color hue of the assignment. An instructor may release an assignment either&nbsp;<strong>manually&nbsp;</strong>(instantly) or via the new&nbsp;<strong>auto-release</strong> system at a set date and time. The "Released Status" of an assignment may be either:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i>unreleased&nbsp;</i>(students cannot see assignment) - no radio button switched and the assignment has a red hue,</li><li><i>delayed&nbsp;</i>(students will see assign at a later date/time) - only "Auto" is switch and the assignment has a orange hue, or</li><li><i>released&nbsp;</i>(students can see assignment) - the "Manual" button is switched and the assignment has a green hue. The manual button takes precedence over the "Auto" button so it doesn't matter if the assignment were set for Auto-release or not.</li></ul><p>For example, the " Lecture 1 - Conservation of Energy" assignment is currently released for the students of the class in the figure below. But, the " Lecture 2 - Heat and Work" assignment isn't released yet and will be on 1/3/25 at 9:00AM. Note that the "Click Me! Clicker test Import" is not released and does not have auto-release set.</p><figure class="image"><img style="aspect-ratio:1041/385;" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfIpG4nC-ECpniNZJOmqmG-V7_k0qC62RIKZmzORB8KTV2LbvCB-3mze2y2r4PoiWQOtvET3ivfhcmVPWy1YfI_4PWUET-iU_qzoQA7auvyS1RUP-yg8IZYPKUq3PKthOppcwrKrg?key=InR0bCdTZIz_VTvJRRGW68pA" width="1041" height="385"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Control Panel</strong></p><p>The Auto-release has a broader scope than just releasing assignments to students a fixed time before the assignment opens. The tool allows for ADAPT to automatically release properties after the close of the assignment including student scores, question solutions, and/or class and individual statistics. These can be manually switched via the "main view" toggle right below the course title. This switches the course view to "Control Panel" view.</p><figure class="image"><img style="aspect-ratio:562/318;" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdDr3VGZiqngoORFqNWEUr2dHbaGcDXNisahbPawW8PDAj-XzNyyAUiBCETlI2DlDTqWRhFMZ9J1ts7ERsorEC_f9xxk9Ch3W1xvRAR44HzufLyH9ZXTlIA6d2Z7larpbLMaJMawA?key=InR0bCdTZIz_VTvJRRGW68pA" width="562" height="318"></figure><p>The Control Panel is structured similarly to the Main View with explicitly release status and release dates for "Scores", "Solutions" and "Statistics". The assignments are color coded based on the Release Status of the assignment from the main view NOT based on the status of the "Scores", "Solutions" and "Statistics". Those are indicated by the radio buttons switches. For example, in the picture below, the Score, Solutions, and Statistics for " Lecture 1 - Conservation of Energy" are set for 1/8/25 at 9:00PM. However, the Scores, Solutions, and Statistics for the " Click Me! Clicker test Import" assignment will not be released at any time via the Auto-release.</p><figure class="image"><img style="aspect-ratio:1040/514;" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeD0ewbtVrCaes4m6tcen8hqanxPzgklRKM-e_FzlGzsxZxtzTYIXtIaTVVjeMjkaa7HvUVRiXBQjKhtV8MtJTLQv2_-SYsafcFpilEVLfRhDt-x7YmRsh0rc0tc9RIQ5aks8B2Fw?key=InR0bCdTZIz_VTvJRRGW68pA" width="1040" height="514"></figure><p><strong>Auto-release Settings</strong></p><p>The settings for autorelease can be found in the "Auto-Release" option under the Course Properties.</p><figure class="image"><img style="aspect-ratio:351/384;" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeHzwVMfod_DQ_Al3rMX32RDDZ2h9eC94HtdBKHv2AAWXuXXYmC8-5OZiOx13h8pYOKDBkeneYrKskpm4RqFuiNF-INfFa6W_gzCm1c33JZb5IJ4NGZU_DugJEtkj2h_lZ22nSi?key=InR0bCdTZIz_VTvJRRGW68pA" width="351" height="384"></figure><p>The auto-release settings is relatively simple and involve selecting the delay and reference date/time ("Condition') for releasing. For assignments, the reference time is set at the "available on" which is the opening time. The example below is set for 5 days before the opening time.</p><figure class="image"><img style="aspect-ratio:782/670;" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdSEc_48Nj98FJ66FpdeZrr7F27-BI1-Gt6jhC45-gPKylj3DNAu98q-5l_hnBUuFd01TJ2mMzO9r62kGEX2hlXdMlfNsI6o-m3vRckwEdZXixrYSWnmc14qoQFSzpbkEiE6DI02A?key=InR0bCdTZIz_VTvJRRGW68pA" width="782" height="670"></figure><p>The Scores, Solutions, and Statistics can have variable reference time. If the assignment has a late policy, then there are two deadlines and you can pick either one for the reference date/time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img style="aspect-ratio:470/189;" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdA_wqb5rN1IcEASILZ29_uxpcTJDDn-5i6Z-vIJfkq23V8ajaVw-PDx6cqu0hTkR86waDH9WwbRBlvRChosJz4VfxqlIsz0liEkv5vfedE8TjsDfJ0MVYa3Z5wfv2OtjnTcipkfg?key=InR0bCdTZIz_VTvJRRGW68pA" width="470" height="189"></figure><p>The example above is that the Scores, Solutions, and Statistics are released 12 hours after the deadline. This is selected to provide a fudge period to address late submissions without requiring addressing.</p><p>The "Global Update" provides the applicable assignment that the parameters selected above apply to. They can be all assignments or ADAPT allows instructors to apply different auto-release parameters to different assignments. For example, the figure below is selecting the Lecture 16 assignment although all assignments can be selected in the menu (not shown on image).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img style="aspect-ratio:658/702;" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcd4Bi5awM1IM4AKKUZ7jT7JUV9lEKmOQqV_Uc2b2dQ2SgpvYmdMn5yyUh73gs1SDoUTgjyEv2l2WDzyY_BvxPEDvqZCz5AcTcyHX0MJcVyXSKGqMfKrgehzzV3HNmUDk4YkZbo?key=InR0bCdTZIz_VTvJRRGW68pA" width="658" height="702"></figure></div>
