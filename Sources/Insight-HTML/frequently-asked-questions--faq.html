<div class="prose !max-w-full"><p><strong>Q</strong></p><p>We are going to order some LibreTexts print books to be potentially put on course reserve, but technical services were unsure how to go about incorporating these textbooks into the library's collection?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a murky issue for us and for open in general, at least those of us that pursue a curatable infrastructure that is constantly being edited. The primary issue is that ISBNs (and DOIs) are meant to be added to static products. Both are intended for content that would have no or limited editing capabilities (e.g., like a version of a book). We are constantly updating content on pages of books such that neither would technically be allowed. We have been discussing ignoring this aspect and assigning ISBNs even to dynamic books under the argument significant changes are not expected, but we are not there yet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We use an internal system based on the library and cover page ID# (e.g., for that book, we assign it at biz-44202). We also have a shortened "tinyurl" like URL for the book too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We cannot use the name IBSN of a different publisher since the book we provide isn't there (the point of ISBN). However, if you will be purchasing books in bulk and you need a ISBN to keep track of things, we can get the ISBNs and assign them to your books. We have been planning to do this even if we are not operating 100% in compliance with the static expectation of the resource.</p><p><br><strong>Q</strong></p><p>If I want to adopt this text in a class, do the students also have to go through a verification process? How does that work?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nope. Not needed at all. The only time that we may lock down student access if is you decide that you want to collect analytics on how your student is using the book. Student accounts in this case are handle without access codes; they just sign up real-time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
