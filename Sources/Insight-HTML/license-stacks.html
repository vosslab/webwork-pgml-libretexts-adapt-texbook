<p class="max-w-6xl"><span class="font-medium">Description</span>: <span class="italic">What is a license stack?</span></p>
<div class="prose !max-w-full"><p>A license stack occurs when a work is governed by more than one license at the same time, and users must comply with the requirements of all applicable licenses. This usually happens when an original work is licensed under one version of a license (e.g. CC BY-SA 3.0) and modifications or contributions are released under a newer version (e.g., CC BY-SA 4.0). In this situation, the combined work cannot be treated as if it were licensed solely under the newer version; instead, both licenses apply simultaneously. Downstream users, therefore, must follow the conditions of each license in the stack-for instance, giving proper attribution, sharing adaptations under the same license terms, and respecting any restrictions specified by both versions. In short, a license stack means that multiple layers of licensing obligations apply together to the same work.</p></div>
