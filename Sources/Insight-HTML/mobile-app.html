<p class="max-w-6xl"><span class="font-medium">Description</span>: <span class="italic">The LibreTexts ADAPT platform offers a mobile app designed to enhance the experience of using its open homework and assessment system. </span></p>
<div class="prose !max-w-full"><p>A summary of the functionality and benefits of the LibreTexts ADAPT mobile app:</p><ul><li><strong>Access on-the-go:</strong> The app allows students to access and complete their homework assignments and assessments using their smartphones, providing flexibility and convenience.</li><li><strong>Adaptive learning:</strong> ADAPT offers adaptive learning capabilities, including a "Learning Tree" approach, where assessments are tailored to student performance and provide remediation for poor performance. This personalized approach can be accessed through the mobile app.</li><li><strong>In-class polling (upcoming):</strong> A key feature expected in the near future is the ability to use the app for in-class polling, similar to clicker functionality. This will enable real-time feedback and engagement during lectures and discussions.</li><li><strong>Variety of question types:</strong> ADAPT supports a range of question types, including those found in platforms like H5P and WeBWorK, allowing for diverse and engaging assessments on the mobile app.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Instructor features</p><ul><li><strong>View student data:</strong> Instructors can view data on student engagement and performance to adjust their teaching strategies, potentially available through the mobile app as well.</li><li><strong>Question and assignment management (possibly limited on mobile):</strong> While the full scope of creating and managing courses, assignments, and questions is available on the web platform, the app may offer a streamlined way to oversee student progress and communicate with students.</li><li><strong>Facilitating labs and collaborative projects:</strong> The app can be used to collect and view responses of the entire class live, which is helpful for labs and collaborative projects.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Essentially, the ADAPT mobile app aims to make the homework system more accessible and interactive for students, and provides instructors with tools for enhancing classroom engagement and assessment. Note that some advanced features, like full content creation, are typically handled on the web-based ADAPT platform.&nbsp;</p></div>
