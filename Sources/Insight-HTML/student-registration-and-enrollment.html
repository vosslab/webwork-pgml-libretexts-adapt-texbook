<div class="prose !max-w-full"><p>How do students register and enroll into their ADAPT courses?</p><h3>LMS-enabled courses (No Access Codes Required)</h3><p>If students are trying to enroll in a LMS-enabled course, then the students are automatically registered via their LMS. The LTI protocol allows for ADAPT to pull the roster and create ADAPT accounts that need to be created and enroll students into the associated ADAPT course automatically. Student can only access their ADAPT assignments via their campus LMS (as Modules or Quizzes). They <strong>cannot </strong>access their assignments directly via the ADAPT website.</p><h3>Non-LMS-enabled courses (Required Access Codes)</h3><p>If students are trying to enroll in a LMS-enabled course, then the students are automatically registered for ADAPT and enrolled into their course via their LMS. Students can only access their ADAPT assignments via their campus LMS. They <strong>cannot </strong>access their assignments directly via ADAPT.</p><h4>Student-specific Access Codes</h4><ul><li>When students are given student-specific access codes each student is emailed a specific access code that works for that student only (tied to the email address of the access code). If the invitation were set with student names (optional but recommended), then the students have ADAPT accounts created for them automatically. However, if the invitations were created with only emails, then the students need to create an ADAPT account manually (see below) before enrolling with the access code.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>Course-specific Access Codes</h4><ul><li>When students are given course-specific access codes each student is given the same access code that works for any student to enroll in the class. Students will need to create an ADAPT account manually (see below) before enrolling with this access code.</li></ul><h3>Manually Registering for an account</h3><p>For a student to manually register for an account (for non-LMS courses only), go to <a href="https://adapt.libretexts.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ADAPT website</strong></a> and click on&nbsp;<strong>Log in/Register </strong>in upper right corner.&nbsp;After the student registers, the student can enroll in the course using the access code (student-specific or course-specific, which ever if applicable). To enroll in the course, sign into the <a href="https://adapt.libretexts.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ADAPT website</strong></a>, click on <strong>Enroll in Course</strong> and the enters the access code online.</p></div>
