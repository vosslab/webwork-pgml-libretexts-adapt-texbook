<div class="prose !max-w-full"><ul><li><i>Effort</i> is a measure of the amount of effort the student expended writing the assignment in terms of time, writing, and editing (including the types of edits). While the Effort score is meant to be advisory, the instructor may consider allocating up to 20 percent of the grade for the assignment to this metric.</li><li><i>Revision</i> is a measure of how much deep revision the student engaged in for the assignment. While the Revision score is meant to be advisory, the instructor may consider allocating up to 20 percent of the grade for the assignment to this metric.</li></ul><p><strong>Note that the effort and revision scores have been tuned for long-form prose writing (e.g., essays 600 words or greater). Effort and revision scores are generally more accurate on pieces of writing 600 words or greater. Depending on the genre the student is writing, less effort and revision may be expected (e.g., a simple homework assignment, where the student answers questions, will likely have less expectation of revision than a long-form essay).&nbsp; Efforts and revision scores may not reflect all changes that the student has made; they reflect the most recent submitted version of the draft (whether submitted by the student or the instructor).</strong></p></div>
