<p class="max-w-6xl"><span class="font-medium">Description</span>: <span class="italic">A Nursing Drag and Drop Cloze question is an assessment format where learners complete a clinical statement or scenario by dragging the correct terms, concepts, or interventions into blank spaces.</span></p>
<div class="prose !max-w-full"><p>The <strong>Drag and Drop Cloze</strong> question type is modeled on NCLEX-style testing, designed to assess higher-order thinking and clinical judgment. In this format, learners are presented with a sentence, scenario, or case study that contains one or more blanks. Below or beside the text is a list of possible words or phrases, only some of which correctly complete the statement. Learners must carefully analyze the clinical context, distinguish relevant from irrelevant options, and drag the correct terms into the blanks. This question type evaluates not just recall, but the ability to prioritize, apply knowledge, and make decisions in realistic nursing situations, reflecting the critical thinking skills emphasized on the NCLEX exam.</p><h3>Creating the Question</h3><p>Bracket off the portions of the text where you would like the Drag and Drop Cloze to occur, using a bracketed response to denote the correct answer. Then, add distractors below. Example: The client is at risk for developing [high blood pressure] and [a heart attack].&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img height="940" width="1089" src="https://d33dptvk57h9ai.cloudfront.net/1e8bae64-02f3-40f5-ab51-941bd09e9977/25651094-d803-44d0-86cf-6d02f148d57f" style="aspect-ratio:1089/940;"></figure><h3>Student View</h3><p>Students will then see a drop-down for each item and will only be able to choose each item once.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img height="601" width="828" src="https://d33dptvk57h9ai.cloudfront.net/1e8bae64-02f3-40f5-ab51-941bd09e9977/c88847cb-1315-4f2d-af6d-1412cc1150bb" style="aspect-ratio:828/601;"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img height="599" width="836" src="https://d33dptvk57h9ai.cloudfront.net/1e8bae64-02f3-40f5-ab51-941bd09e9977/34f30544-5eec-46dd-8b94-8d9c944303fc" style="aspect-ratio:836/599;"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Scoring the Question</h3><p>The format of the question prompt (first image) suggests the scoring of the submission will be contextually (e..g, 'Star Wars' is the correct answer for the second pull-down menu). However, this is <strong>not</strong> how the question operates and a student selecting 'superlaser' for the second pull-down menu will also get a correct answer'Grading of the question results in only the detractors being marked as incorrect.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img height="579" width="746" src="https://d33dptvk57h9ai.cloudfront.net/1e8bae64-02f3-40f5-ab51-941bd09e9977/09c74517-89e6-4b83-9ad0-247c0156ede8" style="aspect-ratio:746/579;"></figure><p>Hence, if the specific entry is important for the specific pull-down spot is important, then this is not the correct question type to use. In that case, you will want to use the Drop-Down Cloze instread.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p></div>
