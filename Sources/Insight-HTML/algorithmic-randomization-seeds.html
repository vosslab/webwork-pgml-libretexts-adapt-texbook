<div class="prose !max-w-full"><h3><strong>Question</strong></h3><p>How is the random seed set to be sure each student gets a different set of randomly generated algorithmic problems?&nbsp; I want to be sure the problem sets will be mostly different for students using these from the same class, even though they are assigned the same WeBWorK problems.</p><h3><strong>Answer</strong></h3><p>Of the four principal technologies in ADAPT (WebWork, IMathAS, H5P, and Native), only WebWork and IMathAS can provide randomized numbers to students in this manner. When a student loads an ADAPT question, a random seed is generated by ADAPT's random number generator. This seed, a number between 1 and 99,999, is saved to the database at the user-assignment-question level.</p><p>If the instructor selects "algorithmic" in the assignment properties and the question is formulated with algorithmic coding, each student will receive different values in the question. However, the scope and intent of the question remains the same. The question is formulated to evaluated and score the student submission subject to the algorithmic coding (instead of a fixed number used in H5P and Native technologies). The solution similarly reflects the different values.</p><p>You can play around with seeing the results in an algorithmic assignment by going into the "fake student" mode and then resetting the submission.&nbsp;This will reset the seed as well so the values change in the question and solution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
