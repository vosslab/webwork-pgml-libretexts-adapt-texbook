<div class="prose !max-w-full"><h3><strong>About the Forge</strong></h3><p>The Forge is based on the idea that&nbsp;<i><strong>the humanity is in the process.&nbsp;</strong></i>That is, in the era of AI writing and paraphrasing tools, we believe that the best way to assess the integrity of student writing is through the depth and quality of students' effort while they are drafting assignments. This focus on&nbsp;<i>process over product</i>-that is, encouraging students' academic growth and effort rather than merely punitively grading errors-is a longstanding principle in academic instruction. Antecedent, however, takes the principle of process writing in new directions for the AI era, offering instructors unprecedented objective measures of student writing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Using Forge as an Instructional Tool</strong></h3><p>We recommend instructors employ the following measures when using Antecedent as an instructional tool:</p><ul><li><strong>Instructors should emphasize to students that they must write assignments from start to finish in the Forge word processor, showing all their work.&nbsp;</strong>Students cannot, for example, write their rough drafts on pen and paper and then type up their assignments. Further, students must have continuous access to the internet while drafting.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Instructors can treat assignments consisting of large amounts of pasted in language as they would plagiarized assignments</strong>. In this case, the language is 'unverified'. (Pasted in language is indicated by green or blue circles in the EssayMap [the larger the circle, the larger the insertion] and spikes in the WordChange graph.)&nbsp;</li><li>While the metrics and scores provided by the system should be understood by the instructor as advisory rather than binding (much like the percentages of unoriginal language provided by traditional plagiarism detection tools), effort, broadly understood, should nonetheless be factored into the assessment of student writing (for example, as a percentage of the grade on the assignment).&nbsp;<strong>Instructors should feel free to override or disregard the Effort and Revision scores provided by the system, but how hard the student worked on the assignment should have some 'teeth' in assessment.</strong></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Example Rubric for an Academic Essay</strong></p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Effort</strong></td><td><strong>20%</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Revision</strong></td><td><strong>20%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Focus and Development</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>Thesis</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>Organization</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Grammar and Mechanics</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Documentation</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>100%</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>If the system provides low Effort and/or Revision scores to an assignment, the instructor should review the Analytics graphs and/or the Rewind before assigning the assignment a low grade.&nbsp;In general, the Effort and Revision scores should be seen as advisory for the instructor. The Effort and Revision scores will continue to improve in accuracy in the coming months.&nbsp;</strong></li><li>In their directions to students, instructors should advise students that:</li></ul><ol><li>They must write assignments from beginning to end in Antecedent;</li><li>The Forge analyzes how they write their assignments and provides information about how they write their assignments to the instructor; and</li><li>That effort will factor into their grade for the assignment.&nbsp;</li></ol><ul><li>For appropriate assignments, instructors can have students submit rough drafts of their assignments for feedback from the instructor before students revise the assignment for the final draft, following longstanding practices in the process writing paradigm. In general, in the AI writing era, instructors should view themselves as collaborators in the writing process rather than just evaluators of writing.&nbsp;</li><li>We recommend that instructors use Antecedent for a number of assignments in a course rather than just one specific assignment, so that the instructors will have the opportunity to reinforce to students that they must write their assignments from start to end in The Forge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>If you wish to see how the application appears to your students, you can join your own class as a student, under the<i> My Classes (Student)</i> button.&nbsp;</p></div>
