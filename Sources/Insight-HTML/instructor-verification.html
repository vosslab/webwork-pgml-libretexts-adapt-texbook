<p class="max-w-6xl"><span class="font-medium">Description</span>: <span class="italic">Curious about what instructor verification is and who can request it?</span></p>
<div class="prose !max-w-full"><h3>What is instructor verification?</h3><p>While the LibreTexts libraries are intended to be as 'open' as possible for reading, we do enforce a basic verification of 'instructor' status for those who wish to create and edit content. We do so as a means of basic moderation to ensure that content remains trustworthy and created with a reasonable level of professional quality. This also helps us to prevent private organizations and individuals from using LibreTexts' libraries as a dissemination method for paid, malicious, or otherwise unsavory content. LibreTexts expects that all verified instructors will create and edit content in good faith.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What does instructor verification give me access to?</h3><p>Successful instructor verification gives you access to:</p><p>1) Creating and editing content on the LibreTexts libraries</p><p>2) Hosting courses on <a href="https://adapt.libretexts.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADAPT</a>, our open homework and assessment system, including accessing our vast bank of existing openly-licensed questions</p><p>3) Hosting courses on <a href="https://forge.libretexts.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Forge</a>, an integrity-enhanced word processor and learning management system.</p><p>4) Instructor-only courses on the <a href="https://libretexts.org/academy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LibreTexts Academy</a>, our professional development and training platform</p><p>5) So much more!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What do I need to submit my instructor verification request?</h3><p>To submit your verification request, please first create a LibreOne account by visiting <a href="https://register.libretexts.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://register.libretexts.org</a>. We kindly ask that you use your institutional email address to speed up the verification process. Once your account is created, you will automatically be prompted to submit your request, or you can do so at <a href="https://one.libretexts.org/instructor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://one.libretexts.org/instructor</a>.</p><p>A publicly available page hosted on your institution's website showing your status as an instructor is generally suitable (preferably listing the same email address you created your account with). Please ensure that the link you submit does not require a sign in (e.g. Peoplesoft, Canvas, etc.) as we will not be able to approve your request. If you do not have a publicly available page, keep reading to learn about other options.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>How long does the verification process take?</h3><p>Most verification requests are reviewed within the same business day. However, please allow up to 48 hours to hear back. If you haven't hear back after this period, please contact our <a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/support/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Support Center</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>How will I be notified of a decision?</h3><p>You will automatically receive an email when a decision is made. If you request is not approved, we will let you know what factor(s) contributed to this decision in that email so that you can review and re-submit if appropriate. You can return to <a href="https://one.libretexts.org/instructor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://one.libretexts.org/instructor</a> at anytime to check the status of your request if you did not receive an email.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>I'm not an instructor? Can I be verified?</h3><p>We realize the label 'instructor' only represents a subset of the educational community - don't fret! Whether you're a librarian, administrator, lecturer, or something else, you're more than welcome to request instructor verification. What we're looking for is that:</p><p>1) You are verifiably employed by (or otherwise affiliated with) a degree-granting institution and</p><p>2) You hold at least an undergraduate degree (e.g. a Bachelor's) or otherwise have the educational background that would be expected of a person in your professional position</p><p>We understand that not all situations are so straightforward. Please submit your instructor verification request with as much information as possible and we will review on a case-by-case basis. <i>LibreTexts reserves the sole right to make a decision on instructor verification requests based on both the provided and publicly available information to maintain the quality and safety of content hosted on LibreTexts.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>I have student assistants working with me on a project. Can they be verified?</h3><p>1) If they are a graduate student and have an institutional webpage (e.g., a university profile or research project page) that lists them, they can register as an "instructor." They'll just need to submit that URL in their verification request just like any other instructor, and we have no problem approving this.<br>2) If they don't have such a page, they should register for a standard student account first. Then, a verified instructor on the project who can "vouch" for them can submit a support ticket, and we'll provide them the necessary editing privileges.</p></div>
