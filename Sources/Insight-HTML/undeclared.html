<div class="prose !max-w-full"><p>We have a range of licenses available for authors to select on the specific page from "All right reserved" (not a fan) to "Public domain" (big fan). We do have two odd ducks: "Undeclared" and "Collective". The former is that a license wasn't identified; we have a page in our back matter call "Detailed Licensing" that shows a map of each page and each license. For this book, there are CC BY-SA and CC BY with some undeclared that can be remedied (see <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://workforce.libretexts.org/Courses/Western_Washington_University/OER_and_LibreTexts_at_WWU/zz*3A_Back_Matter/21*3A_Detailed_Licensing__;JSU!!PvDODwlR4mBZyAb0!UR6uyfUjBRGs9RXgbtkmOxf4pKlWtpJPi3OyYcQbr0q4rwuYhDIZqMLUir2M-FwVinUQzOxHULKKV7wd1c-qZN6dO9KF06K0$" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://workforce.libretexts.org/Courses/Western_Washington_University/OER_and_LibreTexts_at_WWU/zz%3A_Back_Matter/21%3A_Detailed_Licensing</a>).</p><p>The "Collection" indication isn't a license per set and, similar to "undeclared," is a no-license indicator. However, the difference is that this was set because there is no license possible for the content on the page. This is almost always due to conflicting licenses of different IP on the page (i.e., a page hosting both CC BY-SA and CC BY-SA-NC IP). In this case, the licensing of each paragraph block is indicated (technically in all cases that were remixed on LT).<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Our AutoAttribution system will be tweaked next term to provide logic on which licenses are allowed (if at all) based on the licenses of the IP on the page. The AutoAttribution system is a powerful mechanism to facilitate compliance with licensing if the content is remixed from existing content on our platform (e.g., with the remixer).</p></div>
