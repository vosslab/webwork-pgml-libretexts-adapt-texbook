1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,160
 So I've been wanting to adapt my large collection of biology homework questions from kind of

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,600
 a blackboard format to using library text adapt, which kind of uses like a web work

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,680
 type format here, at least the way I've adapted them.

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,040
 That seems to be probably the best format for working with biology problems.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,680
 But first I really needed a good sandbox tester for web work.

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:37,040
 So I took the web work PG renderer, oh gosh, I thought I had the page up, but I do not.

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,280
 I have too many repositories, apologies.

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,280
 That's a web work.

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,280
 That's a web work.

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,280
 That's there guys.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,720
 So yeah, so I took the web work PG renderer, which installs itself via Docker.

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,080
 It's not the easiest thing to set up, I expanded it and modernized it.

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,880
 And now I have this nice thing where I can drop in web work questions, render the question.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,980
 And if I want to go into debug mode, this is, you know, where all the nitty gritty nuts

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,760
 and bolts generated HTML stuff exists, if you want to try and figure out what's going

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,760
 wrong.

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,640
 And that was really critical for me and especially using AI agents.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,380
 And it just kind of runs on my local computer, localhost 3000 here.

19
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,980
 But since about November, last year, November, 2025, AI coding agents have really transformed

20
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,480
 how I write computer code to tell you the truth, I really don't write computer code

21
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,060
 much anymore, but I program all day.

22
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,840
 It's vibe coding has really taken over.

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:40,840
 And one of the deals is that chatgpt is just literally terrible at writing web work questions.

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,120
 Let's let's do an example here.

25
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,800
 Write a simple web work question asking my favorite color where the answer is blue.

26
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,320
 All right, so I am on chatgpt 5.2 auto where it kind of sounds like, oh, yeah, sure, sure,

27
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
 sure.

28
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
 I can do that.

29
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,280
 Oh, the last few times I did it actually just that show partial correct answers to one,

30
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,920
 which means is there a partial correct like if I guess green, is that close to blue?

31
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
 I don't know.

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
 So let's see if it works.

33
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:15,520
 So I'm going to copy this and then go back to my renderer here and up air and you can

34
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,660
 actually go back and forth with chatgpt on this and eventually it'll convince you that

35
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,480
 your renderer is broken and it is it is correct.

36
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,440
 But for the most part chatgpt just cannot do it.

37
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,780
 Clod code on the other hand actually is pretty successful.

38
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,240
 But this is like the easiest question.

39
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:36,240
 If I Google PGML multiple choice example, it's the number two hit is literally I'm sorry,

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,960
 I guess it's not the number two hits.

41
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
 I did this on DuckDuckGo.

42
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,900
 So I know the number nine hit on DuckDuckGo.

43
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,840
 So I have to scroll all the way down.

44
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
 Number nine.

45
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,000
 Oh, gosh, really, oh, here multiple choice of radio buttons.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,440
 This is literally the example question.

47
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,480
 My favorite color is blue, right?

48
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,680
 So it has this information on the internet to grab from, but it just gets confused with

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,800
 all the Perl out there because web works like Perl, but not quite.

50
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,000
 So what did I do?

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,240
 So I mean, this is like the worst part of programming.

52
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,560
 You're stuck debugging someone else's code, which is not what you want to do.

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,880
 So what I've done is probably the best example is like Clod code, you know, it's codex works

54
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,020
 okay.

55
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,480
 It's a little bit slower.

56
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,640
 Well, since I'm sticking to OpenAI, we'll stick with codex here.

57
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,840
 So this is the codex app.

58
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,240
 I have a web work codex forum here.

59
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:38,880
 And I've written a skill, which is invoked with dollars on here called web work writer,

60
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,720
 which basically gives it a whole bunch of documentation, it can use on how to write

61
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,880
 good web work questions, because it's really needed, and it actually is able to connect

62
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:58,240
 itself to the renderer to confirm that its code actually works.

63
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,960
 It's obsessed with finding other files on my file system to use the cheat.

64
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:08,080
 So we'll see if it gets up a thing, it's not the quickest thing I'm going to show a more

65
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,520
 complicated example here that I launched 11 minutes ago, and Clod is still thinking about

66
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
 it.

67
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
 So.

68
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,680
 All right, so here, favorite color blue, I think it was able to test it, we'll find out.

69
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,040
 So let's go back to my renderer.

70
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,520
 Bam, it's gotten a lot longer, and it's actually using pgml format, or it was kind of using

71
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,080
 a hacky format before, it didn't quite work.

72
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,600
 I really don't want to have to debug this some more, but I don't want to spend Oh, yeah,

73
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,640
 so you can't use mice.

74
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,200
 It should know that.

75
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,560
 But yeah, who wants to sit here and debug code for the I'm gonna try and pretend.

76
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,400
 But what if I want to write a more challenging question was my favorite color.

77
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,120
 I've been teaching I was teaching my students last week, on isoelectric points of amino

78
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,120
 acids, you know, it's kind of fancy curve, it's the point where there's no charge, and

79
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,040
 they really when I posted this up on the slides, they're kind of I'm like, which one has the

80
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,120
 neutral or what's the pi here, you know, and they're like, I don't know.

81
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,220
 I got like 50 glazed eyes looking back at me and I'm like, this would be a great question

82
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,040
 to add to adapt.

83
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,640
 I do have a working copy of it.

84
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:23,160
 But for example, here, I just kind of show random amino acid different charges, you should

85
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,560
 be able to add a plus and a minus cancel out to say no net charge and then figure out what

86
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,920
 the pi is based on a titration curve was my idea.

87
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:38,200
 So I wrote up a prompt and, you know, fairly detailed as give this basically give this

88
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,120
 whole prompt to chat GPT here, I want you to write a two part question from scratch

89
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,960
 amino acid isoelectric points part one student selects hypothetical amino acid for three

90
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
 pKa values.

91
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,600
 This is the repo is empty, it's a fresh project.

92
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,780
 But you know, the thing is, it has all these documents to consult because chat GPT wants

93
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:03,320
 to use kind of its own random function, which is not how web work once right.

94
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:11,280
 I was able to fire up codex earlier, I don't think I had to have I mean, it's not something

95
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
 I could really do live in a video.

96
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,760
 But basically, I gave it the prompt, I gave it a picture, I told it to load my skill.

97
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,560
 I told it that all the documents it needs is in the skills, so please don't search my

98
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:27,040
 hard drive, so it's, I have enough guidance to implement the problem now I've created

99
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,080
 a new problem also change log entry the promise.

100
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,600
 I'm now running the local renderer and I had some problems that do more up seeds problems

101
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
 with firmware.

102
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,040
 Yeah, I don't have to debug all that, let it do it.

103
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,720
 Alright, so let's see how its final code came out.

104
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:48,720
 So I'm going to open up the thing and then paste it back into my

105
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
 render here.

106
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,200
 I'm going to use my local renderer.

107
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:59,520
 So it's kind of nice it properly tags the question now, with things it looks like what

108
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,840
 strategy to use.

109
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,320
 I don't know, can you even read that code early?

110
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,320
 Does it work?

111
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,320
 It does.

112
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,760
 I find that the choice on the states is a little bit harder to read, I could use any

113
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,960
 some color, I guess that's probably the correct one there.

114
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,400
 And if we know choice two is the proper one, we can say the PI is probably between these

115
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
 two values.

116
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,080
 So somewhere around 3.2 should be the correct answer.

117
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
 And I got 100%.

118
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,880
 So it's that's one way it looks like cloud is finally getting back to me.

119
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,640
 So you have to have patience when working with these AI things.

120
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,480
 I launched this at 15 minutes ago, it came back and asked some questions about how I

121
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,120
 wanted to do it.

122
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,880
 It's not clear to me if it is, well, it hasn't given me a file, it still says tinkering.

123
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,440
 But you know, it's better for it to kind of sit there and struggle getting the problem

124
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,080
 correct than me sitting there to struggle, you can see it's kind of sending the problem

125
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,320
 to the local renderer to verify.

126
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,120
 So will it do a good job?

127
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
 I don't know.

128
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
 But I did try this earlier.

129
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,520
 And it did finish eventually.

130
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,480
 But I did delete its code, so kind of like that it was very similar kind of rendering

131
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,680
 to the one that came out into my problem here.

132
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,400
 The graph options available in web work are, I mean, they're not the greatest.

133
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,320
 There's some classic ways using LaTeX and stuff.

134
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,880
 And now it's asking for permission to run the renderer means that cloud is probably

135
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,320
 going to take another 15 to 20 minutes to solve the question.

136
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,760
 So I'm going to pop it up.

137
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,880
 I know where it's stuck, should I help give it some guidance, tell it to read the skill

138
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,720
 again.

139
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,120
 I literally have a document on how to render HTML correctly.

140
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:52,560
 It's complaining that I found the PG common pitfalls.

141
00:08:52,560 --> 00:09:00,360
 Oh, I actually have a file I can test now.

142
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,360
 So let's see how Claude's version holds up to the codex version.

143
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,080
 But renders fine.

144
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,620
 Seems weird to have the state separate than the state selected, but the cool I'd recently

145
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,720
 just told it to add color.

146
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,120
 So it's figuring that out.

147
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:24,320
 It did not read the documentation on how to add color to what did just post an update.

148
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,040
 Oh, hey, we got blue questions in one place.

149
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,800
 I know why it was like giving me like, here, let me put the net charge here.

150
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,360
 And then it asked which one's net charge zero and it's like, yeah, no, it's what it renders

151
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,740
 fine in WebRK 2.0.

152
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,860
 This is PG 2.17.

153
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,280
 And okay, it says CPC colors are there and verified.

154
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,200
 Now the thing is, you get into a cycle of back and forth.

155
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:59,760
 And so what I'm going to do is I can take a screenshot and share it as only the side

156
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,960
 chains are colored, not back to fix that fairly quickly.

157
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,200
 I think when I was saying red and blue things, so I can hit the dice here and it gives me

158
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,160
 a different version of the problem.

159
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,720
 See now here's the COOH version.

160
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,240
 But the idea is I'm really into kind of randomizing my questions.

161
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:25,040
 So the P AKA should vary between different versions.

162
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,000
 So students just can't post them the check.

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,040
 Of course, this is, you know, chat GPT probably can't write the question very well, but it

164
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,500
 could probably solve this question fairly easy.

165
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
 But that's not the point.

166
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
 All right.

167
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:42,860
 And I just thought I'd share kind of my system for writing WebRK code using AI agent.

168
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,860
 Something you'd like to change about this?

169
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,860
 All charged groups.

170
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,200
 Sorry, I'm typing it there.

171
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
 The video's over.

172
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,560
 I'm just kind of, you'll see how it kind of I guess the question is, should we not color

173
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,040
 COOH and color COO minus?

174
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,080
 But if I look at the question now, you can see everything is rendered in color.

175
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,440
 Yeah, I'd probably do the neutral ones in like a gray color or something like that.

176
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,640
 So visually stands out more.

177
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,960
 I need to learn a lot more about accessibility, but you know, I do like my color.

178
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,720
 And I do try to avoid red greens.

179
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,320
 You know, being in the Chicago area, I find the bears colors work pretty well if contrast

180
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
 wise.

181
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,860
 So right.

182
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,520
 So anyway, that's one way to code a problem in WebRK.

183
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,960
 You know, I did need to give it some guidance.

184
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,080
 But all the tools are there to debug it at least.

185
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,360
 So I need to know how to program.
