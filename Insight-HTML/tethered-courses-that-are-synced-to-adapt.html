<p class="max-w-6xl"><span class="font-medium">Description</span>: <span class="italic">Let me clarify the nomenclature. In my previous email, a Canvas Master course is what we use at EMCC as the vetted content with local rubrics and common Canvas native assignments.</span></p>
<div class="prose !max-w-full"><p>For iteration 1.0, I didn't want instructors syncing up an ADAPT course with a non-empty Canvas course.&nbsp;My concern was that instructors would accidentally link some courses manually and use the API for other courses which could lead to issues.&nbsp;With that said, I have no control over whether an instructor adds anything to their Canvas account.&nbsp;In addition, it is possible for me to get the Canvas assignments while in ADAPT.&nbsp;I imagine that what I could do is let instructors put anything they want in their Canvas course at any point and from within ADAPT indicate which Canvas assignments are not linked to ADAPT.&nbsp;That might minimize both potential instructor confusion and support requests.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><strong>I'm not quite sure what a Canvas master course is.&nbsp;</strong>A Canvas Master course is course built in Canvas with content and rubrics and activities in Canvas. Our adjuncts have access to it and use it to teach their classes. (Master course: a Canvas course labeled as such, with no students enrolled, and to which other instructors have access - it includes institutional learning outcomes and rubrics, track attendance, Getting started module, timed exams and quizzes, video discussion boards, etc.). Using a master course (to which I add elements from other sources, makes it easy for all instructors to have the same content, regardless of where it comes from- presented in the same fashion, but linked to their respective external tool accounts - be it EdPuzzle, ADAPT, McGrawHill, Lumen, etc.).</blockquote><p><br></p><blockquote><strong>I'm also not sure what you mean by "ADAPT and Canvas courses".</strong>&nbsp;I want to add ADAPT assignments (from the course I set up in ADAPT) to the Canvas master course. In this context, the term "ADAPT course" is really just a collection of assignments (from Tarea Libre).I want to move those around and and add them to weekly modules I am creating in Canvas (in the Canvas Master course),</blockquote><p><br></p><blockquote><strong>&nbsp;The way that it is intended to work is that the assignments are always created in ADAPT and then are sent back to Canvas: you wouldn't start by creating the course in Canvas.&nbsp;</strong>I already have a course in Canvas I want to further customize by adding ADAPT assignments.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><strong>&nbsp;Also, assignments will be sent back based on the assignment group structure in ADAPT.&nbsp;Perhaps we should wait to see if the tethering process works and then I can demonstrate the flow.</strong><strong style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"> </strong>Perhaps. What I want to do requires adding the ADAPT assignment and then move things around and change dates and names accordingly.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>Dates in ADAPT: Can we "batch edit" the dates in ADAPT? (Open them all at once?) Can I edit dates in Canvas?</p><p>Attempts: procedure? Are these set in ADAPT?</p><p>Names in ADAPT/ Canvas: I created these assignments in CANVAS. I now want to change the names of some assignments (remove the numbers, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, for instance: can I do so in Canvas without affecting the "link"? Or, do I have to do it in ADAPT and does the change "auto synch" with&nbsp;the Canvas version?</p></div>
