<div class="prose !max-w-full"><p>In the context of OER, the community uses the term remix to refer to a new work that is created by combining, modifying, or adapting one or more existing OER materials. It’s not just copying—it involves transforming or integrating content in a way that produces a new educational resource. In short, a remix is the creative adaptation of existing open resources to suit a new teaching or learning context.</p><h3>Remixes</h3><p>We use this term to refers the product of combine different resources together to create new derivative works under a single license;</p><h3>Collections</h3><p>Creative Commons calls a collection a "compiling of different works together while keeping them organized as distinct separate objects," which is not an adaptation of the original works. Collections often result from combining content with different licenses and the resulting product is then typically not licensed under a single license, but are governed by a <a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/license-stacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">license stack</a>.</p><h3>Adaptation</h3><p>An adaptation in Open Educational Resources (OER) refers to any modification of an existing openly licensed resource to better suit a specific need. This can include updating content, correcting errors, changing the scope, adding new sections, translating the work, or combining materials from multiple OERs. To create an adaptation, the resource must be openly licensed. The changes can be minor or substantial; what defines an adaptation is the act of altering the original resource in some way.</p></div>
