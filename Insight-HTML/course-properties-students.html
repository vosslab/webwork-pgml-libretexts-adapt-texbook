<div class="prose !max-w-full"><p>Within ADAPT’s Course Properties, the Sections subpage provides instructors with two key management tools: the Whitelist Domains setting and the Student Roster. The Whitelist Domains control allows instructors to restrict or permit access to the course based on institutional or organizational email domains, ensuring that only authorized participants can enroll. The Student Roster feature, on the other hand, provides a centralized view of all students enrolled in the course, giving instructors the ability to review, manage, and update enrollment details as needed.</p><ol><li><strong>LMS-Integrated Enrollment</strong> – For courses linked to a Learning Management System (LMS), student accounts are automatically generated the first time a student accesses ADAPT through the LMS. This ensures seamless enrollment and synchronization between systems.</li><li><strong>Roster Invitations</strong> – For courses not connected to an LMS, instructors can manually invite students using the <i>Student Roster</i> section. This method allows instructors to directly control who receives access and when.</li><li><strong>Access Codes</strong> – In cases where instructors do not have a complete list of student emails, ADAPT provides section-specific access codes. These codes can be distributed to students, who then self-enroll into the appropriate course section.</li></ol><h3>Whitelisted Domains</h3><p>For accounts created using option 2 (Roster Invitations), instructors can enable a restriction that prevents accounts from being generated with email addresses belonging to domains not explicitly whitelisted on the <i>Sections</i> page. This safeguard helps ensure that only students using official campus or institutional email accounts are enrolled. By doing so, ADAPT avoids the creation of duplicate or unofficial student accounts, which could otherwise lead to grading complications or student confusion about which account they should use for homework and assessments.</p><figure class="image"><img height="306" width="857" src="https://d33dptvk57h9ai.cloudfront.net/8f1e4dc9-6c26-45b9-9f7d-f87d613e7b21/c5c70fe1-cb50-4e02-9174-c648041eabda" style="aspect-ratio:857/306;"></figure><h3>Students Roster</h3><p>For option 2 (Roster Invitations), instructors can invite individual students to create accounts and enroll directly into the course. Invitations may be sent one at a time, or instructors can streamline the process by uploading a list of student names and email addresses to generate multiple invitations at once.</p><figure class="image"><img height="243" width="852" src="https://d33dptvk57h9ai.cloudfront.net/8f1e4dc9-6c26-45b9-9f7d-f87d613e7b21/ac29f0a3-efd1-40d3-b788-85c61f1c45d1" style="aspect-ratio:852/243;"></figure></div>
