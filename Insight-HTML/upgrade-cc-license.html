<p class="max-w-6xl"><span class="font-medium">Description</span>: <span class="italic">Can I "upgrade" the License Version of a Creative Commons Licensed OER?</span></p>
<div class="prose !max-w-full"><p>Can an OER that is licensed under <strong>CC BY-SA 3.0 </strong>be released <strong>CC BY-SA 4.0</strong> licence or I am required to use the same 3.0 license?</p><h3>Answer</h3><p>Yes, No, and Kindah.&nbsp;</p><p>One cannot change the version of a Creative Commons license that has already been applied to a work, as the license is non-revocable and creates stable rights for users (subject to compliance to the original license responsibilities). One can, however, apply a different, more permissive license to the same work for future users, but those who used the work under the original license are still protected and can continue to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the Creative Commons Foundation, while the CC BY-SA 3.0 license permits licensees to release their own contributions to a remix under CC BY-SA 4.0, it does not allow them to “upgrade” the license of the original work itself. As a result, the adaptation effectively falls under a <a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/license-stacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>license stack</strong></a> (that is a mixture of CC BY-SA 3.0 and CC BY-SA 4.0 licenses). Downstream users must comply with the terms of <strong>both</strong> licenses rather than either license.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: there is a “forward compatible” clause in the 4.0 Creative Commons licenses that allow licenses to formally upgrade to newer versions, but this mechanism does not apply retroactively to works licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.</p><h3>References</h3><p><a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions#Compatibility_mechanism_in_BY-SA_licenses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions#Compatibility_mechanism_in_BY-SA_licenses</a></p></div>
