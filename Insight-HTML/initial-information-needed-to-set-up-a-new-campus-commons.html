<div class="prose !max-w-full"><p>Information needed to setup a Campus Commons &amp; Conductor instance:</p><ul><li><strong>Organization Subdomain</strong>: This value is used to place the Campus Commons on the libretexts.org subdomain, e.g. uconductor.commons.libretexts.org. <i>This value cannot be self-managed by the organization and must be changed by the LibreTexts team. It will generally be set as the abbreviation of the organization's name (assuming there are no conflicts with existing Commons instances).</i></li><li><strong>Name</strong>: The organization's full name, e.g. "The University of Conductor".</li><li><strong>Short Name</strong>: The organization's shortened name, e.g. "U of Conductor". <i>If the organization does not have a common shortened name, it is acceptable to use the Name in place.</i></li><li><strong>Abbreviation</strong>: The organization's abbreviation, e.g. "UoC". <i>If the organization does not have a common abbreviation, it is acceptable to use the Name or Short Name in place.</i></li><li>Text:<ul><li><strong>Campus Commons Welcome Header</strong>: An emphasized string of text placed at the top of the Catalog Search interface, used to welcome users to the Campus Commons, e.g. "The World's Most Popular Online Textbook Platform, Centralized.". <strong>This text is not required.</strong></li><li><strong>Campus Commons Welcome Message</strong>: A block of text placed at the top of the Catalog Search interface, used to welcome users to the Campus Commons, e.g. "LibreCommons hosts curated Open Educational Resources from all 14 LibreTexts libraries in one convenient location. LibreCommons, the LibreTexts Libraries, and all of our resources are accessible to everyone via the internet, completely free. We believe everyone should have access to knowledge.". <strong>This text is not required.</strong></li></ul></li><li>Links:<ul><li><strong>About Link</strong>: A standard link to the organization's About page, or the main page if one is not provisioned.</li></ul></li><li>Assets:<ul><li><strong>Cover Photo</strong>: A <i>download</i> link to the organization's large cover photo, displayed on the Campus Commons jumbotron. Dimensions should be <i>at least</i> 1920x1080. <i>Organization logos should not be used as the Cover Photo.</i></li><li><strong>Large Logo</strong>: A <i>download</i> link to the organization's main/large logo. This is typically an extended wordmark. Logo should preferably have a transparent background. Resolution should be high enough to avoid blurring on digital screens.</li><li><strong>Medium Logo</strong>: A <i>download</i> link to the organization's medium-sized logo. This is typically a standard, non-extended wordmark. Logo should preferably have a transparent background. Resolution should be high enough to avoid blurring on digital screens. <i>If the organization does not have distinct large/medium logos, the same logo can be used for both.</i></li><li><strong>Small Logo</strong>: A <i>download</i> link to the organization's smallest logo. This is typically the same style used for favicons or simplified communications branding. Logo should preferably have a transparent background. Dimensions should be approximately 800x800. <i>The Small Logo is not currently implemented in any portion of Commons or Conductor, but has been provisioned for possible future customizations. Ergo, it is not required for the initial Commons launch.</i></li></ul></li></ul></div>
