<p class="max-w-6xl"><span class="font-medium">Description</span>: <span class="italic">This guide is for campus admins who want to manage the books that are shown on their Campus Commons.</span></p>
<div class="prose !max-w-full"><h4>&nbsp;</h4><h4 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Prerequisites</strong></h4><p>This guide is for campus administrators only. Instructors do not have sufficient access to manage their school's Campus Commons. If you are unsure who your campus administrator is, please contact our Support Center and we can assist you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Definitions</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Campus Commons:</strong> Your school's branded <a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/glossary-of-libretexts-terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commons &amp; Conductor</a> instance with a branded URL (e.g. https://ucdavis.commons.libretexts.org). Only full <a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/glossary-of-libretexts-terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LibreNet member</a> campuses are eligible to have a Campus Commons set up. This is a space for your school to show off its catalog of OER resources and manage OER-building projects.</li><li><strong>Catalog:</strong> In this context, your catalog refers to your school's curated listing of OER books. These books may be solely from your school, or you can choose to include books from across all of LibreTexts' libraries to build a centralized listing of the books in use by courses at your school. There are additional considerations for assets, projects, authors, and repositories in your catalog however, that is outside of the scope of this article.</li><li><strong>Campus Administrator:</strong> one or more individuals who have been granted the “Campus Admin" role for their Campus Commons and are responsible for managing branding, catalog curation, etc.</li></ul><h4 style="text-align:center;"><br><strong>Understanding Catalog Matching</strong></h4><p>To make catalog management easier, books that are published on a campus bookshelf matching your school's name will automatically be added to your catalog. For example, the text at <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/University_of_California_Davis/UCD_Chem_002B" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/University_of_California_Davis/UCD_Chem_002B</a> is automatically added to the UC Davis catalog.<br>&nbsp;</p><h4 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Catalog Matching FAQ:</strong></h4><p><strong>Q: </strong><i>What if my school has multiple aliases (e.g. University of California, Davis and UC Davis)?</i></p><p><strong>A:</strong> This is a common concern. You can visit your Campus Settings to manage aliases that should be used for automatic matching (<strong>Control Panel &gt; Campus Settings &gt; Campus Aliases</strong>).<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Q: </strong><i>What if I don't want to any books to be automatically matched?</i></p><p><strong>A:</strong> We understand some organizations want explicit control over what books appear on their Campus Commons. You can toggle automatic matching by visiting <strong>Control Panel &gt; Books Manager &gt; Disable (Enable) Automatic Catalog Matching</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4 style="text-align:center;"><br><strong>Locating the Books Manager</strong></h4><p>The Books Manager is the primary interface for campus administrators to curate the books available in their Campus Commons. To get started, navigate to your Campus Commons and visit <strong>Control Panel &gt; Books Manager</strong></p><figure class="image"><img height="620" width="460" src="https://d33dptvk57h9ai.cloudfront.net/4908dbdc-1345-4c66-bbc6-88146915344b/6bfad348-2395-4b8c-8328-50ac79dbc177" style="aspect-ratio:460/620;"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img height="460" width="620" src="https://d33dptvk57h9ai.cloudfront.net/4908dbdc-1345-4c66-bbc6-88146915344b/7e42b238-3154-41e7-a034-b5a29ca15f27" style="aspect-ratio:620/460;"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h4 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Using the Books Manager</strong></h4><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>About the Interface and Finding books</strong></p><p>The default Books Manager interface displays two lists: <strong>Available Books</strong> and your <strong>Custom Catalog</strong>. The Available Books list displays all book in the global LibreTexts catalog that have not already been added to your Custom Catalog. The Available Books list is organized into a “tree” of the same URLs that books actually exist at on a LibreText library. For example, the book at <a href="https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Early_Childhood_Education/Trauma_Informed_Education_(Krishnamoorthy_Ayre_and_Schimke)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Early_Childhood_Education/Trauma_Informed_Education_(Krishnamoorthy_Ayre_and_Schimke)</a> will be found under <strong>Social Science &gt; Early Childhood Education</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note that “Campus Bookshelves” on a library are denoted with a graduation cap icon, whereas regular bookshelves (usually organized by subject) are denoted with a bookshelf icon. For example:</p><figure class="image"><img height="460" width="620" src="https://d33dptvk57h9ai.cloudfront.net/4908dbdc-1345-4c66-bbc6-88146915344b/b8b83f47-7f06-4a32-9fbd-62d0b3ce2daa" style="aspect-ratio:620/460;"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img height="460" width="620" src="https://d33dptvk57h9ai.cloudfront.net/4908dbdc-1345-4c66-bbc6-88146915344b/465b05e6-2eb0-4a53-a686-b3ab1c5b5643" style="aspect-ratio:620/460;"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img height="460" width="820" src="https://d33dptvk57h9ai.cloudfront.net/4908dbdc-1345-4c66-bbc6-88146915344b/4b5688cc-769a-45c5-8acd-9505dba25573" style="aspect-ratio:820/460;"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can also search and sort by book title, author(s) name, the LibreTexts book ID (e.g. chem-9794), or the full book URL (e.g. <a href="https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Sociology/Introduction_to_Sociology/Introductory_Sociology_3e_(OpenStax))." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Sociology/Introduction_to_Sociology/Introductory_Sociology_3e_(OpenStax)).</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Adding and Removing Books</strong></p><p>To add books to your catalog, simply click the checkbox next to the available book(s) you want to add and use the “right” arrow to add them to your catalog list. Your changes are saved and reflected in your Commons immediately. To remove books, simply follow the same process to select books in your catalog list but use the “left” arrow to move them back to the available list.</p><figure class="image"><img height="915" width="1889" src="https://d33dptvk57h9ai.cloudfront.net/4908dbdc-1345-4c66-bbc6-88146915344b/dae4f350-a08c-4383-a4db-2d4d61db0679" style="aspect-ratio:1889/915;"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Alternative (Plain View)</strong></p><p>For a more utilitarian interface, you can also click <strong>Browser Master Catalog in Plain View</strong> at the bottom of the Books Manager page. This view allows you to browse the entire LibreTexts global catalog in table form and click a single button to add or remove a book. In this view, each book will have an action button that can be one of three states:</p><ol><li><strong>Add to Custom Catalog.</strong> For books that aren't currently in your catalog</li><li><strong>Remove from Custom Catalog.</strong> For books that are currently in your catalog</li><li><strong>Exclude Automatic Match.</strong> For excluding a book that may have been inaccurately matched to your catalog, or is otherwise undesired. This option will <i>only</i> be present if automatic matching is enabled.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img height="907" width="1889" src="https://d33dptvk57h9ai.cloudfront.net/4908dbdc-1345-4c66-bbc6-88146915344b/b619b207-c09b-4c22-ae14-5c8234355af3" style="aspect-ratio:1889/907;"></figure></div>
