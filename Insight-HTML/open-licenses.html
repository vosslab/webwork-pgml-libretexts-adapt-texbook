<div class="prose !max-w-full"><p>Open Educational Resources (OER) are teaching, learning, and research materials that are freely available for anyone to use, adapt, and share. What makes OER truly “open” is not just free access, but the legal permission for educators and learners to revise, remix, reuse, redistribute, and retain the materials. This is made possible through open licenses. Open licenses—most commonly Creative Commons (CC) licenses—provide a standardized, legally recognized way for creators to specify how their work can be used by others. By applying an open license, authors grant the public explicit permissions beyond the restrictions of traditional copyright, enabling collaboration, adaptation, and innovation in education. For example, an instructor might share lecture notes under a CC BY license, allowing others to copy, adapt, and build upon the notes as long as credit is given. Different license types offer varying levels of openness, ranging from fully open (e.g., CC BY) to more restricted (e.g., CC BY-NC-ND, which prohibits commercial use and adaptations).</p><p>Open licenses thus serve as the foundation of the OER movement, empowering educators worldwide to share knowledge freely, reduce costs for students, and foster a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement in teaching and learning.</p><ul><li><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/license-compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>License Compatibility</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/license-stacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>License Stacks</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/remixes-collections-adaptations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Remixes, Collections, and Adaptations</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://commons.libretexts.org/insight/upgrade-cc-license" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Upgrading License Versions of OER</strong></a></li></ul></div>
