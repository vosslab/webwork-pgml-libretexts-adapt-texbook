<div class="prose !max-w-full"><ul><li><i>Active Writing Time</i> is the sum of all the time that the student was consistently writing while editing the document.&nbsp;</li><li><i>Think/Pause Time</i> is the sum of all the short to medium-length pauses during the writing process. Think/Pause Time is understood as including both moments of cognitive effort while writing and short moments of distraction or focusing on other tasks. Long gaps are considered breaks and not included in Think/Pause Time.&nbsp;<strong>Writing that is quickly typed out, such as if a student is typing out a previously written essay, will generally have Active Writing Time roughly equal to or greater than Think/Pause Time.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</li><li><i>Total Writing Time</i> is the sum of&nbsp;<i>Think/PauseTime</i> and&nbsp;<i>Active Writing Time</i>, plus all breaks in writing reduced to medium-length pauses. In general, the longer the total writing time, the more effort the student expended on the assignment. Very short writing times may be understood as a red flag.&nbsp;</li></ul></div>
