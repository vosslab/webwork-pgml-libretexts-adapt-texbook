<div class="prose !max-w-full"><p><strong>PGML</strong>&nbsp;stands for "PG Markup Language", and it provides a method of creating the text of a PG problem that is easier and more flexible than the traditional&nbsp;<code style="background-color: rgb(248, 249, 250); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">BEGIN_TEXT/END_TEXT</code>&nbsp;approach. PGML is based on the&nbsp;<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: rgb(51, 102, 187);" target="_blank">Markdown</a>&nbsp;language that now underlies many blog and wiki software, so you may be familiar with some of its syntax already. Note, however, that there are many flavors of Markdown, and PGML may not implement everything exactly the same as the markdown dialect that you use elsewhere. There are also important additions to PGML specifically for working with PG, such as the ability to create answer blanks, or insert values of variables created earlier in the problem.</p><p><br></p><p>PGML provides easy means of creating paragraphs, lists, headers, indentation, centering, and other formatting features. It also allows you to link the answer directly to its answer blank for easy problem maintenance. The underlying idea behind PGML is to make what you type as the text of the problem look as close to the result on screen as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>PGML is for creating the&nbsp;<em>text</em>&nbsp;of the problem and for associating answers to their answer blanks. The setup and computational portion of the problem is still done in the traditional way. PGML integrates with&nbsp;<a href="https://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Category:MathObjects" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: rgb(6, 69, 173);" target="_blank">MathObjects</a>&nbsp;to make it easy to work with answers and answer checkers, and to present mathematics within the text of your problem.</p><p><br></p><p>PGML can also be used to create the solutions to your problem, with many of the same advantages that you have for the text of the problem itself.</p><p><br></p></div>
