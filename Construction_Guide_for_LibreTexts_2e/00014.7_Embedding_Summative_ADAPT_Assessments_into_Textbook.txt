14.7: Embedding Summative ADAPT Assessments into Textbook

Section 5.7 of the Construction guide discusses how to embed interactive assessment into Libretexts pages in a formative manner
(i.e., without a gradebook). The ADAPT system also allows the embedding of Adapt assessments in your LibreTexts book in a
summative manner. This allows students to find them easier and complete the assignments without leaving the textbook.

You can create a separate page for embedding assignments or add them to existing pages. See Construction Guide to learn more on
page creation.

Students have to be logged into their Adapt account to see the embedded assignment. Assignments won't be visible in the print
version of your book.

Embedding Summative Assessments
To embed a new Adapt assignment to your LibreTexts page:

1. First add the assignment and assessments to ADAPT itself. See Adding/Importing Assignments and Adding New Assessments
to learn more
2. Copy the assignment ID. You can select the text - Right click -- Copy or just click on the copy icon next to the ID

7. You can edit the numbering if you have more than one embedded assessment. If you have 3 Adapt assessments on the same
page by default they all will be labeled "ADAPT 1", but if you change the numbering you can have "ADAPT 1", "ADAPT 2"
and "ADAPT 3"

8. Click "Save" to save your page. You should see your Adapt assessment embedded.

If you see an error message "You are not logged in!" you need to log in using Campus Login or (if you don't have campus
login setup) you need to open Adapt website, log into your account and then refresh the LibreText page.

For practice problems, you can also embed problems as 'formative' which do not require login

To do this, the assignment must be set up as a Formative assignment in ADAPT. Then all the same steps can be followed as above.
