6.2: LibreOne Single Sign On (SSO) and External Authentication

There are two primary mechanisms for logging into LibreTexts libraries. The first is direct authentication that involves your
username and password. The alternative is the Single Sign On (SSO) infrastructure that allows users to use campus credentials to
authenticate. This is available for any user with an email that is either Google- or Microsoft enabled (most US campuses).

Below is a step-by-step procedure to login

Step 1 - LibreTexts Login using Email and Password

Go to https://one.libretexts.org or https://one.libretexts.org/home and login

Login with LibreOne

LibreOne allows you to access all LibreTexts applications with just one login.

Step 2

After registering you end on the Rocket page from which you can go to the applications or the libraries. In most cases you will
select the Conductor or Adapt. If the login has been successful your account and status (Verified Instructor, Unverified Instructor,
Student) is shown at the upper right where you can also log out.

At this time, the top line is extremely boring. The Rocket page is Home for this part of the system. Your profile is just your avatar
and name. You can change your avatar and name by selecting Profile and then editing it. Security allows you to change your
password. Instructor shows your Instructor status and has links to a few useful videos.

Google/Microsoft Directory Sign In

The process for signing in is similar to the one used for many applications these days.

The SSO system is coupled to accept both google and microsoft authenticated networks so that if your campus is part of either,
you can use your campus account to sign in. However, Microsoft provide additional freedoms to campuses to verify vendors
(like LibreTexts) to access campus authentication.

Even though LibreTexts, Inc. is already verified with Microsoft, in this case it also has to verify with the local IT department of
the campus. That can be a fast or slow process. If instant access is needed (and Google isn't an option), we provide local
authentication via the Email/Pwd combination. Contact support@libretexts.org for help.
