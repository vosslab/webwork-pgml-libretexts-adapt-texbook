9.3: Adding and Editing Equations

Our adding equations video tutorial on YouTube:

youtu.be/74bSIf-4Y 4A.
Equations in LibreTexts are handled by the MathJax add-on (based on LaTeX). This page contains guidelines and references on how to use
this system. It is fairly straight-forward for anyone who has ever worked with code (markup).
Inline vs. Displaymode Equations
To add an equation, authors have two choices: either (1) inline or (2) display. The difference is demonstrated here:

An inline equation looks like this, E = mc", and is meant to be read with the paragraph. An equation that is presented in display mode looks
like this

E=me (9.3.1)
with the equation taking up the entire line. Note that the displaystyle equation is automatically numbered.

To invoke an inline equation add \( and \) around the LaTeX code (discussed below). To invoke the display mode add \| and \] around the
LaTeX code. The code can be somewhat complicated and must be formulated properly or the MathJax add-on will not render the equation (or
will do so improperly). Examples of MathJax code, including some useful templates, can be found at the bottom of this page.

# Mathpix: The Tool you Can't Live Without

MathJax is a little overwhelming at first but thankfully there is a tool that makes it super easy called MathPix Snip.

e Download the tool from https://mathpix.com/ and install it on your computer

e When you need to transfer an equation press ctrl+alt+m and select the equation that you want to copy.

e Use the first line that doesn't have any environment coding and add the \( or \[ for inline or display mode environment manually.

e Ifthe snipper got a few details wrong you can edit the code and check that it renders before copying it over

e If it is a complicated equation zoom in on it using your browser before using the tool. If it still doesn't work consider snipping the
equation in several parts.

Intrapage Numbering and Referencing of Equations

The MathJax system is ideal for referencing equations on a page. Equations in displaymode (i.e., used with
(9.3.2)

delimiters) are automatically numbered, inline equations (using delimiters) are not. If you want to reference a displayed equation you give it
a label by writing \label{name} after the equation but before \]. For example, the following code

\[- E =mc42 \label{Einstein} \] See Equation \ref{Einstein}

renders as

E=me (9.3.3)

Oibretexts:

See Equation 9.3.3

If you do not want a display equation to be numbered you can use \nonumber after the equation (and drop the label text since that is
unneeded.

| \[- E =mc42 \nonumber\]

renders as

E=mc

Interpage Numbering and Referencing of Equations
Interpage referencing is a bit more complicated. The best option currently involves HTML rather than MathJax.

e Source page: This is the page you want to link to. Once you edit the page, place your cursor at a place you wish to create a link. Then
select Elements on the menu and choose the Anchor option. You can use it like you would \label in LaTeX/MathJax. It adds a little flag
that is visible when in Edit mode.

e Reference page: This is the page on which you wish to place a link to an anchor on another page. Go to this page and open the edit view.
Highlight text you want to be a link. Go to Elements menu again and click Link (there is also a button on the blue WYSIWYG editor bar
for this). Select the source page and at the bottom entry titled "Jump to anchor or section", you will see the text you used for the label on
the source page. Save this link and save the page.

If the equation shows up just under the floating blue bar, you can move the anchor to the paragraph before to make it display as desired (small
issues until we get it fixed).

When editing math pages

e Besure to use the escape character \ in front of all trigonometric functions (sinz, cos z, tan x) natural logarithms (In x), etc. Then leave
a space between the function and its argument unless there is a parentheses there. For example, \sin x or \sin(x) (rendering as sina and
sin("), respectively). If you don't do this, the results may look like this: sina, cosa, \sinx, Inz, \lnx

e Use the escape character \ in front of "lim" for limits.

e If limits, integrals or sigma notation (sums) are to be used as part of inline mathematics, be sure to add \displaystyle as the first

. sing
commands of these inline math expressions. Here is what a limit should look like when rendered correctly: lim
a0 2£

, and incorrectly:

. sing
limz+0

e Display mode mathematics will never need \displaystyle.

¢ Do not use \displaystyle unless it is helpful for making one of the above mathematical notations render nicely.

e To obtain larger fractions in an inline setting like - i instead of small ones like a use \dfrac instead of using \displaystyle with

22
\frac which would have the same effect, but is overkill unless the \displaystyle is needed for another reason like those listed above.

e When using display mode mathematics between \| and \], consider whether the equation is an important result that may be referred to
later in the text or not. By default display mode mathematics lines will be aut\nonumbered. If the equation is not a main result, it should
typically not be numbered, so you will need to insert a \n\nonumber at the end of it but within the expression.

¢ Do not use any extra commands, like \mathrm, in front of every instance of math in a page to try to get text to look a certain way. There
should be a better way to get the desired effect.

e When editing integrals, please use a spacing element before the differential. For example, \displaystyle \int x*2 \, dx.
