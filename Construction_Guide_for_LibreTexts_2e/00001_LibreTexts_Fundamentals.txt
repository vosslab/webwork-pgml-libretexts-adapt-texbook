CHAPTER OVERVIEW

1: LibreTexts Fundamentals

The goal of the LibreTexts project is to establish a vetted, comprehensive, and widely-used platform for the dissemination and
implementation of customized course materials for post-secondary courses, while significantly reducing existing textbook costs for
students. The LibreTexts project consists of 13 independently operating and interconnected "libraries" that focus on augmenting
education in separate fields via a series of open-access online textbook environments that includes complementary ancillaries that
advance diverse pedagogical methods and support multiple student learning styles. The LibreTexts libraries currently benefits over
100 million students per year and is arguably the most visited chemistry website in the world.
