11.2.6: How to Incorporate Data Files in Your Code Blocks- For SageMath

There are a number of ways data files and can be incorporated into code blocks. However, ensure that you have already followed
the steps in the introduction to the CKEditor Binder Plugin Tutorial here.

Method 1: Using Libraries

The CKEditor Binder Plugin supports Python which is what SageMath runs on, libraries that are supported by our version of
Python may be used to read in the file. An example code block is provided below. To reuse this, simply exchange the provided url
with the one attained from your own page.

import csv
import urllib2
import ssl
import codecs

url = "https://chem. lLibretexts.org/@api/deki/files/265970/auto-mpg.data"

request = urllib2.Request (url)
response = urllib2.urlopen(request, context=ssl. create unverified context())
csvfile = csv.reader(codecs.iterdecode(response, 'utf-8'))
for line in csvfile:
print(line)

restart restart & run all

Here's a quick example of the things you can do using SageMath. Run the cell and your eyes will be blessed by a wonderful fully
3D parametric egg.

= (Lambda u,v: cos(u), lambda u,v: sin(u)+cos(v), lambda u,v: sin(v))
parametric plot3d(f, (0,2*pi), (-pi,pi))

restart restart & run all
