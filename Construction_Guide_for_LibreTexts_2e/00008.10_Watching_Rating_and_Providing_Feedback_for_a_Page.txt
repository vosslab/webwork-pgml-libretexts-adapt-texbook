8.10: Watching, Rating, and Providing Feedback for a Page

While the LibreTexts team has a curation sub-team that cultivates the content on the library (in coordination with contributing
authors), community curation is also a key aspect in keeping our content "living" rather than stagnating (e.g., in a dead format).
There are three key aspects to facilitate: Watching pages, Rating Page, and providing Feedback on Pages.

Watching Pages
1. Navigate to the page you want to subscribe to.
2. Click the Page Notifications (star) icon in the upper right-hand corner of the page and select the appropriate radio button to set
your subscription.

If you are on a Category or Guide page and want to receive notifications on all content in that Category or Guide, select the option
for This page and all subpages. To subscribe to all content on your site, navigate to each top-level Category or Guide from your
homepage and subscribe to all subpages.
