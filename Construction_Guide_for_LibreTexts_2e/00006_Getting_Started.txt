The goal of the LibreTexts project is to establish a vetted, comprehensive, and widely used platform for the dissemination and
implementation of customized materials for post-secondary courses, while significantly reducing textbook costs for students. The
LibreTexts project consists of 13 independently operating and interconnected "libraries" that focus on augmenting education in
separate fields via a series of open-access online textbook environments that includes complementary ancillaries that advance
diverse pedagogical methods and support multiple student learning styles.
