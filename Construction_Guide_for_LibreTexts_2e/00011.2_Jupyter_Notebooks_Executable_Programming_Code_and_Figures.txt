11.2: Jupyter Notebooks (Executable Programming Code and Figures)

CKEditor is a rich text editor which enables the user to write content directly inside web pages or online applications. Through the
Binder Plugin, authors of textbooks have the option to include code within their textbook pages to create a more interactive
experience for their students. Currently the plugin supports Python 3, Julia, R, Octave, C++, and SageMath. Additionally, all
languages with the exception of SageMath support syntax highlighting for an easier scripting experience.

The following video tutorial provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the tutorial.

Step-by-Step Process to use CKEditor Binder Plugin

Creating a new page

Authors have the option to add code to a new page.

Locating the Plugin and Adding Code

The Binder Logo is the last button on the navigation bar of the text editor. Binder is an external resource that lets you build and run
kernels which contain the necessary packages for executing any given code language.

Add Code

To add a block of code, select the language and add your code in the text space. Be sure to press "run" and verify the code output

before inserting the code cell into your page. This output will be displayed by default on the webpage even if the cell has not been
run by the reader.

Y An Example Page

Remember to press save once edits to the page are done, the following is an example page utilizing the Binder Plugin. As seen,
authors can use libraries and packages already available. If a package you would like to use is not available, simply email us,
or open an issue on the GitHub repository (information found in the dialogue box of the plugin).

NumPy + Table of cor

There are many python libraries that are useful for machine learning. On of the most foundational libraries used in NumPy, Through @ NumPy array it
represent 2-D datasets as a matrix. Columns in the matrix can represent features, and rows can be samples, or vice versa. Here is an easy way for |
2x3 NumPy array containing zeros.

beray{{{0., 0., 0.) (0., 0., 0.)))

Notice that the library needs to be imported in order to be implemented. Furthermore, NumPy represents matrices in a series of lists. If there are 2 rows,
be 2 lists. If there are 3 columns, then there are 3 elements in each list. If you already have a list of values that you want to make into a NumiPy array, thi
also possible.

run restart
beray({f 1, 2, 3, 41. £5, 6, 7, 8L.[ 9, 10, 11, 12), (13, 14, 15, 16]])
MatPlotLib

A oreat part about NumPy arravs is that thev can be used with MatPiotLib to olot the data points in the matrix.

How does CKEditor Binder Plugin Work? (Work in Progress)

A Jupyter Notebook Backend

As mentioned above, CKEditor is the general interface that you use to edit Libretexts pages, while the CK Edtitor Binder plugin
allows you to insert code cells and is accessed via the navigation bar in the text editor. The best way to understand how the Binder
plugin works is to think of it as turning your Libretexts page into a Jupyter notebook. As explained by Jupyter, these notebooks
"are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results [of some project] (figures, tables, etc..) as
well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis". This means that they can contain both computer code
and rich text elements. Put this way it becomes clear as to how a Libretexts page, which may contain richly styled text in addition
to code cells, operates very similarly to a Jupyter notebook.

Just like in Jupyter notebooks, the Binder plugin uses kernels to execute code cells. On Libretexts, when you insert an interactive
script and select a language the plugin will provide you with the proper kernel to execute that language. Each page may have only
one kernel (programming language), and the kernel is activated behind the scenes the first time you "run" a code cell on a page.
Once activated, the kernel remains alive and activated across the entire webpage just as it would in a Jupyter notebook. For
instance, this is why you can put all of your Python import statements into a single code cell at the beginning of your document
and later make calls to those modules in seperate cells.

The Jupyter notebook image below should help solidify the analogy even further.
