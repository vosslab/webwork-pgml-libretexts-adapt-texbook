9.4: Adding Alt-Texts

Adding alt-texts descriptors to images on the LibreTexts is critical to satisfy Search Engine Optimization and also accessibility to
screen-readers for students with limited visual skills. For information regarding alt-texts check out these pages.

There are two approaches to adding alt-text to the images and tables of the LibreTexts depending if the text needs to be
construction or already exists.

Approach 1: Adding Existing alt-text text to images

This is the easiest approach, which is largely a cut-paste approach. While this approach works best on a two-screen system, it can
work fine enough for multiple tags on a single browser/screen. There are three steps: Prepare, Copy and Paste:

e Prepare:
o The LibreTexts page and its source page needs to be open in independent browsers (or tabs). For example:
= https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/General_Chemistry/Book%3A_Chemistry_(OpenSTAX)/01%3A_Essential_Ide
as/1.1%3A_Chemistry_in_Context
= https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@12.1:Gv1lbKcKt@7/Chemistry-in-Context (source)
o Copy:
= It is best to install an add-on to the web browser to easily view and copy alt-texts on a web page. There are many out
there. The one that the LibreTexts team recommends is the alt-text-tester: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alt-
text-tester/koldhcllpbdfcdpfpbldbicbgddglodk.
= Then each figure needs to be stepped through. For the the first image of the source page, if you hover and double click
the alt-text will go into the computer clipboard

speculations were spread from Egypt, China, and the eastern Mediterranean by alchemists, who endeavored to transform "base
metals" such as lead into "noble metals" like gold, and to create elixirs to cure disease and extend life (Figure).

Attempts to understand the behavior of matter extend back for more than 2500 years. As early as the sixth century BC, Greek philosophers discussed a system in which B

water was the basis of all things. You may have heard of the Greek postulate that matter consists of four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. Subsequently, an
amalgamation of chemical technologies and philosophical speculations were spread from Egypt, China, and the eastern Mediterranean by alchemists, who endeavored to
transform "base metals" such as lead into "noble metals" like gold, and to create elixirs to cure disease and extend life (Figure \(\Pagelndex{1}\)).

Figure \(\Pagelndex{1}\): This portrayal shows an alchemist's workshop circa 1580. Although alchemy made some useful contributions to how to manipulate matter, it
was not scientific by modern standards. (credit: Chemical Heritage Foundation).
From alchemy came the historical progressions that led to modem chemistry: the isolation of drugs from natural sources, metallurgy, and the dye industry. Today,
chemistry continues to deepen our understanding and improve our ability to harness and control the behavior of matter. This effort has been so successful that many
people do not realize either the central position of chemistry among the sciences or the importance and universality of chemistry in daily life

Chemistry: The Central Science

Chemistry is sometimes referred to as "the central science" due to its interconnectedness with a vast array of other STEM disciplines (STEM stands for areas of study in
the science, technology, engineering, and math fields). Chemistry and the language of chemists play vital roles in biology, medicine, materials science, forensics,
environmental science, and many other fields (Figure \(\Pagelndex{2}\)). The basic principles of physics are essential for understanding many aspects of chemistry, and
there is extensive overlap between many subdisciplines within the two fields, such as chemical physics and nuclear chemistry. Mathematics, computer science, and .

Approach 2: Writing and Adding alt-text text to images

This approach is similar, but require crafting a proper alt-text before pasting into the image properties box. The protocols for
formulating "good" alt-texts will be forthcoming.

*% Best Practices for Alt-Texts

e Keep alt text limited to 144 characters.
e Create caption for content over 144 characters.

o Blank alt tag (decorative) should be used for images that carry no useful information.
e Do not create alt tags for images discussed on page, mark as "decorative".

Some other issues to be aware of:

e Tables of information should not be posted as images and needs to be recreated on the page.
