7.2: Copy-Transcluded and Copy-Forked Remixes

The Remixer generates "transcluded" pages that mirror the original primary content. To edit the content on the new Remixed page,
authors have to "fork" the page to copy the HTML content from the original master page into the the new Remixed page.

When and How to Edit Original Page

Except for pages that you created only administrators and developers can edit the original pages on the Bookshelves or Campus
Bookshelves without special permission. If you spot an error that needs to be corrected or believe that the text in the original page
can be improved please contact https://commons.libretexts.org/support or info@libretexts.org. They may make the changes or grant
you permission to edit the original page to fix mistakes, improve language, fix formatting, or other things that don't change the

meaning or flow of the original page. Remember, others may have remixed from those pages and if they are changed their text will
also change.

If you have permission, to edit the original page, first edit the transcluded page and you will see a screen like this:

When and How to Create a Copy of the Original Page to Edit

If you are altering the content of the original page to fit into a different flow than the original book, changing the pedagogy of how
the material is presented, deleting subsections, or otherwise majorly modifying the original, you will want to "fork" the original
page. Forking a page creates a copy of the original page in the new location that is completely independent of the original and you
can edit it as you see fit (without affecting the original source page).

The easiest way to do this is with the "Forker" which works automatically by pressing the icon next to the remixed (and transcluded
page). Then authors can edit the remixed pages without affecting any other page on the platform. The downside is that any
upgrades to the Master content will not be reflected in these forked pages.

SKILLS TO DEVELOP

© Touse the rules for naming ionic compounds.

After learning a few more details about the names of individual ions, you will be a step away from knowing how to name ionic compounds. This section begins the formal study of
nomenclature, the systematic naming of chemical compounds.
