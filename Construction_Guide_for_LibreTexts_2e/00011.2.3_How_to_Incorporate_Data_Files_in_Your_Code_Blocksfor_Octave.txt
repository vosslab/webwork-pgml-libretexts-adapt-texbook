11.2.3: How to Incorporate Data Files in Your Code Blocks- For Octave

There are a number of ways data files and can be incorporated into code blocks. However, ensure that you have already followed
the steps in the introduction to the CKEditor Binder Plugin Tutorial here.

Method 1: Using wget

The first method that can be used to get a data file in your code block is with wget. Follow the example below and replace the
example URL with the one attained in the previous step.

lwget https://chem. Libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/265970/auto-mpg.data

run | restart restart & run all

Remember to press the "Run" button prior to pressing "OK". Printing both the code and output will provide the below result, to
avoid this simply check "Insert Code Only" after pressing "Run" in order to achieve the example above.

lwget https://chem. Libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/265970/auto-mpg.data

restart restart & run all

Once the data file has been loaded, use Octave code that you may normally use to read out the lines in the data file.

Octave also has the system() function which allows system commands to be run, for example:

system('wget https://chem. libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/265970/auto-mpg.data' )

n restart & run all
