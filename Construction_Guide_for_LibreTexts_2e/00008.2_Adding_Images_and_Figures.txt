8.2: Adding Images and Figures

Images can be added to LibreTexts via two primary mechanisms:

Adding Figures the Hard Way - Manual Upload

Three steps to add non-copyrighted (e.g. public domain, Creative Commons, original photos or figures) images or pictures:

e "Save" the figures into jpg, png, gif or some other graphics file depending on the program you are using to make the image.
e Then "attach" the file using the lower right hand button on the page or under the "more" button.
e Then "edit" the page with the edit button and "link" the file to your page with "insert/edit image" button.

Adding Figures the Easy Way - Drag and Drop

e "Save" or "export" the figures into jpg, png, gif or some other graphics file depending on the program you are using to make the
image (JPG and PNG are preferred).
e Drag and drop the image from your desktop to your page (while editing).

While the basic principles of editing and creating content on the LibreTexts site are limited, there are several skills need to Master to use the
LibreTexts before creating and curating content. The Construction Guide and Forum are great resources to consult in building these skills:

Basic Skills Remixing Skills

1. Make (or take) ownership of sandbox in the Workshop area 1. Construct a simple Remixing Map
2. Make a chapter (guide) in your sandbox 2. Remix that map (either as transclusion or copy-source)
1. Make a Section in your sandbox 3. Move remix to personal sandbox (i.e., take ownership)
3. Rename Page (standard is "number: Title")
4. Edit page (new or blank page and edit an existing page)
1. Copy/past Existing Text
2. Make hyperlink (chain link)
3. Add Box via templates
4. Add equation
5. Add video
6. Add table
5. Transclude (reuse) a page
6. Advanced
1. Add interactive component (via transclusion)
2. Add Executable code (e.g. Python, R Sagemath)
7. Add Copyright
8. Add Authorbar
1. Watch a page (little star next to social media buttons)

e NO BMP figures are allowed to be imported. Avoid TIFF. Use PNG, JPG, GIF figures instead.

e Please CROP your figures to remove superfluous white space that makes reading your module awkward. The Microsoft
Office Picture Editor or Paint will crop images and is free on MS operating systems.

e All figures constructed for this project must have the original image files used uploaded to the LibreTexts, preferable in the
module itself. DO NOT HOTLINK images. Hotlinks in general are prone to vaporization.

The Medium Way - Copy and Paste Screenshots

Often when integrating content from dead libraries like PDF or scanned images, the Print Screen option can be used. On PC, there
is a "Print Screen" button on the upper right corner of the keyboard that will take a screen shot of the screen and store it in the
computer clipboard. This can then be "pasted" directly via the control-v combination directly into the LibreTexts Editor. The

problem with this is that the image that is being copied and pasted via this mechanism will typically have superfluous content
around it and will need to be cropped before editing. There are two ways to address this:

e Paste the screen shot into a image editor (e.g., Paint in Windows or Powerpoint) and then crop it in that respective software,
save into a file and drag-and-drop into the page as discussed above.
e Alternatively, a screen shot snipping tool can be used to selectively copy the image on the page from the rest of the screen (sort

of like pre-cropping) and then you can paste directly into the editor (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13776/windows-
use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots).

There are other snipping tools available via a simple Internet Search. Apple computers have a similar snipping tool. You can use
Shift-Cmd-4 to save a screen snip of an image on the screen. This image file can then be edited as needed and then imported into a
LibreTexts page, following the protocol described above.

Formatting Figures

Double-click on an image (in edit mode) to open its settings and make sure these settings are set correctly:

Size:

as "responsive"

Double check that image URL starts like this. If not the image has not
been properly copied over and is still hosted on original server. ance

Figure 8.2.1: Image settings

To center justify figure, click on the right side of the image (not the figure) and you can use the center justification for text off the
normal editing toolbar.

Adding Captions

To add a caption add a line under the figure formatted as

| Figure \(\PageIndex{i}\): Copy and Paste Caption here. (Copyright; author via source

where z is the number of the figure on the page. This automatically formats the caption into the caption style you see on the figures
on this page. Unfortunately, if you add another figure that requires renumbering the figures after it this still has to be done
manually. You can use (\PageIndex{n}\) to sequentially number tables, videos, examples, etc. All figures should be open source, if
possible provide a link to the original source.

# Figure captions Format

The figure label should be formatted as shown for the figure above:

e Center justified

e "Figure" in bold followed by numbering with a page index command and a colon like this: Figure
\(\PageIndex{1}\):
e Manually enter the figure number in the \PageIndex command, "1" for the first figure of the page, "2" for the second, etc.

Advanced (alt-texts)

Each Figure and Table has a simple option to add alt-texts. Just double click on the image to get the figure setting (Figure 8.2.1)
and you can add alt-test into the entry. See section on Alt-texts for more details.
