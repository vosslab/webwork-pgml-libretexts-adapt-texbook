11.1: Interactive Figures

Interactive figures and simulations can usually be found in the Ancillary Materials section of each Library. They can be added into
textbook pages by simply transcluding, in the same way as is outlined in Section 3.1A, by clicking "Content Reuse" with the pull
down menu. Below is an example of embedding the Javascript figure from this page:

Figure 11.1.1: Interactive CalcPlot3D figure created by Paul Seeburger (Monroe Community College).

There are also other interactive web-based tutorials and simulations that take advantage of the computational features of an online
textbook. These include other interactive tools such as virtual laboratories, tutorials, and real-time concept tests.
