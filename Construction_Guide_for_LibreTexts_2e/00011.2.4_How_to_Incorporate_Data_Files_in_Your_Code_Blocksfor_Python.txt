11.2.4: How to Incorporate Data Files in Your Code Blocks- For Python

There are a number of ways data files and can be incorporated into code blocks. However, ensure that you have already followed
the steps in the introduction to the CKEditor Binder Plugin Tutorial here.

Method 1: Using wget

The first method that can be used to get a data file in your code block is with wget. Follow the example below and replace the
example URL with the one attained in the previous step.

lwget https://chem. Libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/265970/auto-mpg.data

run | restart restart & run all

Remember to press the "Run" button prior to pressing "OK". Printing both the code and output without, will the below result, to
avoid this simply check "Insert Code Only" after pressing "Run".

lwget https://chem. Libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/265970/auto-mpg.data

restart restart & run all

Once the data file has been loaded, use Python code that you may normally use to read out the lines in the data file. An example
code block has been provided below.

inFile = open("auto-mpg.data", "r")
line = inFile.readline()

while True:
line = inFile.readline()
if line == '"":
break
line = line.strip()
lineList = line.split(',')
print(lineList)

un restart restart & run all

To ensure that the above code block runs successfully, the user needs to run the wget code prior to running the above code if both
parts are added in separately.

Method 2: Using Python Libraries

The CKEditor Binder Plugin supports Python 3, libraries that are supported by this version of Python may be used to read in the
file. An example code block is provided below.

import csv
import urllib. request
import codecs

url = "https://chem. libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/265970/auto-mpg.data"
ftpstream = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
csvfile = csv.reader(codecs.iterdecode(ftpstream, 'utf-8'))
for line in csvfile:
print(line)

restart restart & run all
