7.1: How to Make a LibreTexts Remix

This tutorial will walk you through making a customized text using the LibreTexts remixing tool. The Remixer tool can be used for
simple tasks like creating a book that consists of select chapters of an existing resource or it can be used to create complex remixes
consisting of multiple resources potentially across libraries. You can also create empty pages if you want to create your own
content in parts of your customized book. Before creating a customized remix it is recommended that you construct a Remixing
Map to guide you in building your remixed text and this tutorial assumes that you have a remixing map prepared.

% Analogy

It can be useful to think of the remixer as email and imap/POP3 application on a personal computer.

email Remixer
'Your emails are on an email server somewhere Your texts are on the LibreTexts server

You download the email to your personal computer when you You download an image of your text to your personal computer

download emails to your email application when you" load a text" in the remixer or create a new text
When you want a newly constructed/edited email to sent (go When you want a newly construction/edited text to be live, the
live) your email browser talks to your email server remixer talks to the LibreTexts server (via "publishing).

With the remixes, if you didn't publish the text (i.e., upload to

LibreTexts websites)

With the remixer, any changes to a text (or a newly created text) will not be reflected on the LibreTexts server until you
"publish" those changes (green button). They will be saved as remixing maps on your personal computer only.

Finding the Remixer
The best place to access the remixer from is the Project Page with the @)yar@)Hi0s%Suie.i button.

Request to Publish

Occasionally people will try and remix books in Libraries where they don't have permissions. In those cases trying to remix will
fail with a message that permission was lacking. Should this happen you should contact an administrator at info@|ibretexts.org.

You can also access the Remixer from your book when you are logged in. Each Library has a primary toolbar at the top (below the
library logo). The toolbar is black when a user with an instructor's account has logged in and grey otherwise. There is a blue toolbar
on the far left. The Tools selection on the blue toolbar has an icon labeled "Remixer" that when clicked will load a new page with
the Remixer for making customized textbooks on the specified library.

Getting Started

Since users without instructor's accounts can access the Remixer, the first step in using the Remixer is to confirm you can, in fact,
use it to publish a remix (i.e., your account allows publishing new texts). Once loaded, if the Remixer screen has a dark grey bar
with the term "Demonstration Mode" on the left (Figure 7.1.4), then you will not be able to publish your text. However, you can
still create an online map of your customized text and save it for future editing/publishing. Register for an instructors account
https://register.libretexts.org that lets you publish .

The Remixer worked best on Chrome or Firefox browsers, if using Safari please switch over to ensure full features.

The OER Remixer tool allows the rapidly assemble of customized Remixes from existing sources on our comprehensive and ever-growing libraries. See
the Remixer Tutorial in Chapter 7 of the Construction Guide for more details for an explanation of the Remixer's interface and videos to a walkthrough
videos of how to do basic tasks with the OER Remixer. Your Remixing Map is stored automatically on your computer as you build, so you do not have to
complete your Remix in one setting. If you switch to a different computer, you will want to save the Map.

Creation Steps

Step 1: By default, the Remixer generates "copy-transcluded" pages that mirror the original Master content. To edit the content on
the new Remixed page, authors have to have to "fork" the page in the Editor to copy the content from the original master page into
the new Remixed page. Copy-forked pages copy as traditional copied pages, which, once copied, can be edited independently of the
content of the master page. You can convert individual sections/pages to distinct forked copies at a later time in order to customize
them. Only developers and administrators can generate copy-forked pages directly in the remixer

Step 2: A popup tutorial can be turned on by flipping this switch. Use as needed.

Step 3: The aut\nonumberer ensures the constructed Remix follows a consistent number scheme and more importantly, adapts to
the changing structure of the remix as new content is added, deleted or reorganized. It is recommended to turn this on (switched to
the right). There are options available for the aut\nonumber (blue button below aut\nonumber switch); it is recommended to avoid
these until users are more proficient with the remixer tool.

Dragging and Dropping Content

The Remixer has two panels: The library panel and the Remix panel (Figure 7.1.6). The library panel on the left side contains the
existing content on the LibreTexts libraries and the Remixer Panel on the right side is where you will create your new Remix. The
basic remixing approach is to drag content with the mouse from the Library Panel to the Remix Panel. To insert a chapter or section
from an existing book simply find it in the Library panel and drag it to where you want it in your remix.

Step 4: Find content you desire to remix by selecting the library under "Library panel" (default is the library the Remixer was
opened in) and page through the hierarchy tree. Once found, use the mouse to click on it and drag it to the Remix Panel. Content in
the Remix panel will be green since this is a new page being created (ONLY after the Remix is published). You can continue to drag
and drop content in different spots in your Remix Panel.

Reorganizing Remix Content

You can edit your remix by inserting or deleting pages and dragging sections and chapters around as you desire. Above the Library
and Remixer Panels is the editor bar (Figure 7.1.8). Here you can add a new (empty) page, change the title of a page or chapter,
delete a page or a chapter, undo your latest changes, start over with a new remix, or publish a remix.

Step 5: Rearrange chapters and pages as desired. If aut\nonumber is on, the title numbers will adjust as you reorganize your
content. Delete unneeded pages and add new content from the Library Panel. Actions can be reverted via the undo/redo buttons.

The organization in the Remix panel will be automatically stored in on the user computer in the web browser's cookies. They can
also be forced to be saved via the "Save Map" below the Aut\nonumber Options (Figure 7.1.5). This allows you to share your
remixing map across computers or with other people. It is recommended that you save each remix until you become comfortable

with the Remixer.

Take Ownership of your Remix

New remixes will automatically be placed in the Workbench and be reachable through your Project Page in the Conductor. They
can also be reached directly via their URL or

Step 7: Click on the blue text in the lower right, "Your new LibreTexts is available here". This will open up the newly published
Remix in your Sandbox.

Edit Remix

It is important to note that while the remixer is a powerful tool for combining existing content in the desired organization, typically
further editing is desired at the paragraph/sentence level within the pages. This requires direct editing of the pages of the newly
publish Remix using the procedures outlined in Chapter 8 and Chapter 4.

Step 8: Edit/curate remix as needed by manually editing individual pages.

Reremixing the Remixer

Often, it is desired to reorganize existing remixes or to add or delete content in the remixes. To do that, the re-remixer mode should
be used. Before going to the re-remixer you should move to the book you want re-remix on a tab in your browser and invoke the
Remixer from there.

Step 9: To do this go to the Remixer from your Project Page or from the Book as described above

Once the Remixer is in the name of the book should appear. Except for Developers and Administrators users can ONLY remix texts
linked to their projects or for which they have permission from the owners. In general these are texts on campus bookshelves for
which they have permission (usually only the ones that they have created)

Once the remix is generated, it pulls up in the Remix Panel just like Step 4. The remix can be reorganized with pages added and
deleted just like in the Remixer mode. However, in contrast to the Remixer mode, different colors can be found depending on if a
new page is created (green), or if a page title is changed (orange) - often via the aut\nonumberer - or if a page is deleted (red)
(Figure 7.1.13). Users can also pull content from the Library and add to the Remix panel as desired.
