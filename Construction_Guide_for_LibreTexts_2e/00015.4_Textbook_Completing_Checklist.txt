2: Summary II

Write a short (or longish) summary paragraph that is pasted to the top page. This text doesn't show up in the printed version, but
provides a valuable overview to faculty and students when loading your text. This is best forumulated to address: (1) the target
course(s) of the text, (2) the target audience, e.g., lower divisional, introductory etc., (3) specific flavors/emphasis of the text e.g., if
the text has a cultural responsive or localized focus. It isn't needed to add authors to this summary since that is covered by the
branding bar and attribution footer.

This text is designed for the two-semester general chemistry course. For many students, this course provides the foundation to a career in chemistry, while for
others, this may be their only college-level science course. As such, this textbook provides an important opportunity for students to learn the core concepts of

chemistry and understand how those concepts apply to their lives and the world around them. The text has been developed to meet the scope and sequence of
most general chemistry courses.

3: Bots

While this part of the publishing and compiling process, authors can request bots to run over existing page on a book at any time.
The standard bot is the "Bradbot" named after Brad Pitt, which is so named since the bot "prettifies" the page by standardizing
underlying code that may be difficult to establish manually.

Meta Data

1: Summary II

Rewrite the summary from above into the "summary" block under the "page settings" (you may need to expand it). This has a
limited amount of text (about three lines) that is about the size of a tweet (280 characters). This summary will show up in searches
for books, also is used for the Commons catalog entry for the text after being compiled and it also shows up on the back of physical
copies of the text.
