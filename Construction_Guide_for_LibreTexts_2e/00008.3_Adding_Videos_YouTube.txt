8.3: Adding Videos (YouTube)

Our tutorial for adding videos is on YouTube: youtu.be/zuzkGdWawy0

Currently the best way to add videos is to link to YouTube videos, although other streaming platforms will work. LibreTexts is
working to create a bespoke Video archive. The following steps can be use to embed YouTube videos.

Step 1

Identify the URL of the video you want. This is typically done by finding the video and copying the URL from the web browser
URL line. For the video below, the URL is "www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxLmeHMgvTg&t=8s"
