Acknowledging Authors

For OER the question arises about how to credit pages which have been edited. If remixing has been used to create a page, the
author metatag should have been carried forward and the acknowledgement at the bottom of the page should reflect this. If, for
some reason, you need to add new/additional authors you use the method set forth in Section 10.5 or you can use the
metatag author@ Your Name and Institution.

If need to acknowledge more than one person, add another author tag or add an author tag with multiple names

Another way of acknowledging contributions is to add text at the end of the page which describes how different people have
contributed. For example
