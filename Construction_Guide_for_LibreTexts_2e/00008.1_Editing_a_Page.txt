8.1: Editing a Page

If you are new to LibreTexts and need to start on your text, the best thing is to use the Remixer to start. Go to Chapter 7 to learn
how to set up your book.

The Mindtouch platform we are using for the LibreTexts uses a modified CKE editor that allows for module construction without
having to build/edit the raw source (HTML) code directly. The LibreTexts editor is a WYSIWYG editor that automatically creates
HTML from visual authoring. The editor displays when you create a new page or edit a page. We strongly recommend that you use
the Remixer to create new pages as it will automatically renumber chapters and pages as needed after you add the page. The
CKEditor is a ready-for-use open source WYSIWYG text editor from CKSource designed to bring common word processor
features directly to web pages, simplifying their content creation.

You can only edit pages for which you have editing permission, generally speaking pages in your sandbox, your team's sandbox if
you are a team member, and pages in books that you have created, either de novo or by remixing.

1. Navigate to the page you want to edit.

2. On the MindTouch toolbar, select Edit.

3. Edit the content as necessary. See a complete list of editor tools.

4. In the Edit summary field at the bottom of the page, leave change notes for other editors or yourself (optional). Edit summaries
can be viewed in the page revision history.

5. Click Save to save the changes you made.

utomatic saving & Word Counts
e Automatic saving - By default, the LibreTexts libraries autosaves pages every 25 seconds in case your browser crashes or
computer restarts so that you can return to the page and pick up where you left off.
e Word count - A word and character count is displayed in the upper right corner of the editor UI.

The Editor

The Editor has been configured for most of the needs contributors require. The layout is below; please refrain from using the
advanced features in red until you are familiar with the Mindtouch structure. The Toolbar is the section located at the top of the
editor window. It contains menu buttons that give you access to various functions of CKEditor. All buttons are grouped according
to their function and include both simple operations (like basic text styling or formatting) and more advanced features (like
inserting media or forms via a dialog window).
