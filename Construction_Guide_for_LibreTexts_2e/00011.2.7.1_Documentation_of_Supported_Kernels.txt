11.2.7.1: Documentation of Supported Kernels

The LibreTexts platform lets you write, build, and run code within the text editor through the Binder Plugin. This plugin currently
supports Python 3, Julia, R, Octave, SageMath, and C++. There are various kernels provided by the platform, which process the
code that you type and display the results. Each of these kernels support and execute a specific programming language and version.
When you select a language, the associated kernel is automatically launched, performs the computation, and produces the results.
For example, the ipython kernel executes python code. A full list of all the Jupyter Kernels is available here. It includes all the
information on each of the kernel's documentation, its installation process, supported languages and versions, and 3rd party
dependencies. However, if you are only interested in knowing how to use the supported kemels, refer to the following
documentations or examples:

e Python3 - [Python

e Julia - (Julia

e R-IRKernel

e Octave - octave_kermel

e SageMath - SageMath

e C++ - xeus-cling
